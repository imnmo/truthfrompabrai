 thank you so much as always for being
 here we're incredibly grateful
 and uh let's get started if you're ready
 well uh irwin it's a pleasure to be here
 with you i always look forward to
 uh to this this particular session
 uh every year and actually uh uh
 you know the best way to learn is to
 teach
 and uh i always come away slightly wiser
 at the end not so much
 because of what i said but because what
 some of the interactions and such so i'm
 very grateful and uh so i'll i'll go
 through
 some prepared remarks i mean they're not
 really prepared but
 they're uh let's say a monologue and uh
 i have a few slides
 and uh and then uh then i think we can
 open up for
 questions which is the fun part for me
 and
 we can focus on what i talked about or
 we can focus on
 pretty much anything under the sun maybe
 other than
 you know specific portfolio positions
 and such and
 uh and uh we can take it from there is
 that good
 oh yeah here it is okay all right so uh
 in the in the early 2000s uh
 this book came out uh by maggie maher
 and actually
 uh uh buffett had recommended this book
 it's a it's a great book to read
 and uh basically baggy pointed out
 that even though we have these uh
 like if you look at the s p over a
 hundred year period you know nine odd
 percent a year
 uh that's not the full truth
 uh if you will and uh there's
 there's more to that than just that just
 that nine percent
 and um and so uh this is a chart
 of the dow from uh
 1896 till now so it's covering about
 124 years and
 and you can see that there have been
 very long periods uh where end to end
 the result has been zero for investors
 uh
 so like for example a famous one is
 after after the crash of 29 it took
 a good quarter century uh to get back to
 the same levels
 and uh and more recently uh you know if
 you look at the
 period from 65 to 82
 uh the dow was like i think 870 or 865
 or so at that time
 in 65 and that's approximately where it
 ended
 in 81.82 so 17-year period when the
 u.s economy grew quite a bit but the dow
 was uh
 was flat and then 82 to 99
 uh which is also probably before the
 time of most of the people
 uh attending uh
 the dow was turbocharged you know it
 went from less than a thousand
 to more than twelve thousand and then uh
 more recently uh you know from 99 to
 2011
 uh was flat and then since 2011 we've
 been on the rise so
 um and then you know if i just uh
 if i uh i'll show you a few more charts
 uh like this but but this particular one
 uh has some symmetry so
 the symmetry is that we had a 17-year
 period
 uh you know 65 to 82
 where the dow was flat and we had
 another exact 17-year period
 when the dao uh you know did
 incredible things and and the reason we
 get these
 um these periods and especially i think
 17 years is an important number
 in general human memory does not
 go past 17 years and the reason we see
 these
 kind of long periods of flat markets and
 then
 you know similar periods of you know uh
 very
 uh very euphoric rises in prices if you
 will or just rise in prices
 uh is usually um
 like for example in 1965
 stocks were quite overheated um you know
 very high p e ratios uh high multiples
 and in 81 82 they were
 extremely undervalued and one could
 argue whether it's undervalued because
 at that
 time in 81 or so
 treasuries were yielding 18 um
 and uh and so in the 8182 time frame
 you could have bought a lot of blue
 chips at single-digit multiples you know
 coke and mcdonald's and
 you know all kinds of great businesses
 were available
 very very cheap and then when you got to
 99
 2000 those same businesses
 were priced for perfection
 so so for example
 in the year 2000 microsoft became
 for some time the most valued company on
 the planet
 cisco was right up there both these
 companies were about 600 billion or so
 in value
 and microsoft i think was making less
 than 10 billion
 and such it was a pretty i think it was
 at a 70
 plus uh trailing earnings uh multiple
 and uh so so these these charts are very
 relevant to me because
 um i always have great timing in life
 and i started my fund in 1990
 1999 and what
 a beautiful time to start a fund
 uh i actually knew uh pretty soon after
 i started
 that i was
 i was going to be i
 assumed at that time that there was uh
 poetry and symmetry and
 history did not just rhyme but history
 repeats itself so i just assumed
 that till 2016 um we were going to be
 flat
 uh i assumed we were going to be flat on
 the doubt of 2016 and i assume we won't
 be flat on the dow
 on the s p till 2016 or so and
 the nasdaq i didn't even know when that
 would uh come back because that had
 crashed and burned
 from five thousand down to one thousand
 um
 uh so i thought that was just done for a
 very long time
 um and uh and so
 uh so i started my my journey as an
 investor
 in 94. uh that was the first time i
 heard about warren buffett
 and uh it opened up a whole big world
 for me
 and 1994 was a one of the
 uh you know one of the years of
 maximized learning and growth for me i
 i was i was it was a completely new area
 for me
 and i was just like a sponge i was just
 you know
 uh drinking from a fire hydrant and it
 was great
 and uh and at that time um
 you know uh life was really good because
 uh
 pretty much anything you did went up you
 know
 things and i i was a i was running an
 i.t business
 uh i was uh kind of you know around the
 software business and so on
 and so i had uh
 some some of the investments uh were
 tech investments
 uh at that time and uh in that period
 uh and i was only running my personal
 money at that time there was no fund
 and in that period um i
 uh captured uh two
 more than 100 baggers
 unfortunately
 there wasn't much of a net worth and
 so for example one one business i
 uh business in india i did i put about
 10 or 12 000
 and i cashed out about 1.5 million and
 of course i should not
 uh you know have any regrets about that
 that's pretty good
 um and and then there was another
 business
 here in the u.s so the india business
 was satyam
 satyam computers and the one the u.s
 which was a way to you know
 kind of ride the internet wave and so on
 upside the downside
 a company called cmgi actually which was
 i actually visited them in massachusetts
 around that period
 um and that was uh that was about a
 hundred bagger
 which i captured and there i actually
 put in more money i put in about a
 hundred thousand
 and uh so that is also pretty good there
 about 10 million
 so uh but but then when i was starting
 the funds in
 uh 99 and 2000 and so on
 i knew i was gonna be facing these huge
 headwinds
 and uh and i knew that uh
 that pretty much anything you looked at
 uh didn't look uh i mean the
 uh i think all the all the popular stuff
 was
 was euphoric but actually the day the
 nasdaq peaked in march 2000
 march 9th or something 2000 was the day
 that berkshire hit a
 multi-year low uh so basically what was
 happening is that
 money was going from berkshire hathaway
 into pets.com
 you know there was a transfer going on
 so a lot of stuff
 actually which was very basic stuff was
 undervalued in
 99 2000 but if you were trying to play
 any kind of momentum game or you know
 flavor of the day or any of that stuff
 you very quickly got your head handed to
 you um
 and because then then the nasdaq went
 from like five thousand to one thousand
 next couple of years
 uh two three years uh so i i knew that
 the
 uh so the modus operandi i i
 um took on when i started my fund was
 i really didn't care about the market
 much i knew the market was going to give
 me a headwind
 but i said how does it matter what these
 market levels and all that are
 or whether it's euphoric or not if all i
 do is i focus on buying a dollar for 50
 cents
 and when that dollar gets to 90 cents or
 more i sell it
 and uh and so that became the
 the cornerstone of how i invested is i
 looked for
 dollar bills that were uh trading for 50
 cents or less
 and then as they get tonight got to 90
 cents or more
 i was uh unloading them which was
 different from the previous
 five years where like for example the
 company i bought in india
 i just took those shares and i actually
 got physical chairs
 stuck them in a drawer and my mental
 model was to never open that drawer
 i wasn't even concerned with you know
 what the multiple i knew that they had
 so much tailwinds in terms of growth uh
 that i didn't want to really mess with
 any calculations i just said
 you know set it and forget it kind of
 thing and the same thing
 uh with cmgi i could not tell kind of
 what the
 upper limits of cmgi were it was kind of
 very nebulous
 but i was buying at a pretty floor price
 uh because cmj i was spawning.coms
 so you know harmony.com they're going to
 spawn i have no idea
 uh what valuations are the ones those
 gonna have no idea
 but it all looks like wild and crazy so
 we'll just keep the mother ship that
 keeps producing these eggs
 and uh see where it goes and and you
 know eventually it got to a ridiculous
 valuation
 thankfully i was smart enough to sell
 and move on
 uh but in in the in the last 20 years
 or 21 years i took this
 buy it 50 or less or less and sell it 90
 or more
 and uh that that
 that actually works quite well
 in this environment from 1999 to 2011.
 it it so what i'm what i'm trying to say
 is that
 if i look at my 25 year or 26 year
 journey
 i was using two different models
 for two different periods okay and
 and one of the things i forgot you know
 because it had been so long that i've
 been doing the
 buying at 50 and 70
 that it completely left my mind
 that i'm supposed to at some point
 switch back
 okay and and i never really i just
 thought this buyer 50 seller 90 is kind
 of the way
 i go through permanently and uh let me
 just go through some of these slides and
 then i'll continue
 uh with kind of because uh the year 20
 2020
 you know most humans want to go from the
 year 2019 straight to 2021.
 they want to purge 2020
 that they want to behave like 2020 never
 happened
 you know that's how they would like to
 go through life um
 in my case 2020
 i would say has been probably the second
 highest uh year of learning
 after 94. uh and so
 i've had incredible learning and growth
 this year
 i'm very grateful for the learning and
 growth who knows if the pandemic had
 anything to do with it maybe
 it did because i got so much time to
 stare at my navel
 and uh you know when i contemplate my
 naval good things happen
 so i had a lot of contemplation of the
 naval this year
 um and anyway so this is the dao
 and you look at the s p and uh
 you know it's uh it's somewhat similar
 it didn't have the exact 1717 but you
 know recently
 until 2013 it was completely flat
 and uh and then you look at the nasdaq
 and uh what a beautiful chart
 uh so you look at the nasdaq and from
 1980 to 2000
 you know 20 a year
 awesome great and and then
 of course you can see the head handed to
 you uh
 from 2000 till 2003 or something when it
 you know gets close to a thousand
 and then it takes uh 16 years
 to get back to the 5000 level and then
 more recently
 it's you know been doing that 21 or so
 uh so the nasdaq is kind of interesting
 because it's actually uh
 gone through this uh and and actually if
 you think about the nasdaq yes from 1980
 to 2000
 there was incredible technological
 innovations
 in tech and software and and hardware
 and so on but so was the case
 from 2000 to 2016. i mean even till now
 i mean the you know there's been uh
 incredible
 uh changes but what happened is that the
 valuations in 2000
 was so high that
 all the all the growth and
 growth and uh you know growth and
 profits and all of that
 were not enough uh to
 uh get the index back to where it was so
 for example a good example is microsoft
 i remember in 2000
 i just started the fund there was a guy
 who was
 one of the early early employees at
 microsoft pretty high up and
 he'd retired and he said you know he
 joined my friend he said monitoring if
 you're ever in seattle
 i could introduce you to some of my
 former colleagues and and some people
 have left and
 they may have an interest in your fund
 and so on uh
 so i told him hey you know i'm gonna be
 in seattle day after tomorrow
 you know what a coincidence and uh
 so he said oh that's great so uh we
 spent a day
 where he took me to microsoft
 headquarters
 and i went from one office to the other
 and he was trying to
 he was a great sales guy for me trying
 to convince these guys to
 give me money and i i got a lot of
 commitments uh and
 a lot of investors uh from microsoft uh
 or for all former microsoft people
 some current some former it was great
 but i told them all at that time
 when we were just talking that uh i said
 look
 you guys have in many cases 90
 of your net worth in microsoft stock and
 options
 and your livelihood comes from the same
 place
 and i said i hate to burst your bubble
 but this
 is not going to end well um
 and and they all told me oh you don't
 understand our business
 uh the companies never it you know the
 stock just goes up like clockwork
 and we get our options and we hang on to
 them and life is great
 and uh i told them that was not going to
 be the case
 uh but none of them actually even wanted
 to hear the math about
 the 70 times trading earnings whatever
 else and
 until 2015 or 16
 microsoft was zero returns uh and
 it wasn't just zero returns uh it was a
 very violent ride uh with a with a huge
 drop in the next two or three years
 and then another huge drop during the
 financial crisis it was
 uh it had been very very hard to hold
 the stock
 uh over that period and of course
 finally
 uh they've kind of uh digested that and
 now we're
 back on the upswing and then then we get
 to the nikkei
 um which peaked in 1990
 and has not yet
 come back and so it's been
 30 or 31 years of uh
 minus two percent a year and uh
 so uh
 the more fun the party
 the more extreme the hangover and
 this was a very fun party uh this was a
 party like no other
 uh so at that time i think in 1990
 uh you know and this was anecdotal
 evidence i looked it up the
 um they said the imperial palace in
 tokyo
 uh was valued more than all the real
 estate
 i mean the entire state of california in
 terms of real estate
 and i actually found that statistic
 pretty hard to believe so i actually
 researched it
 and it was absolutely true actually if
 you looked at the
 the transaction prices of uh
 the properties right around the uh
 around the imperial palace
 and then you extrapolated to the you
 know square footage
 and acreage of the imperial palace you
 would get to
 a valuation that would exceed state of
 california
 and uh and of course that's a ridiculous
 valuation
 uh we have beautiful coastline for
 thousands of miles
 here in california and uh and there's
 some very very
 very very um uh valuable real estate
 and so um so that bubble popped
 and uh we haven't come back yet and uh
 we'll have to see when we come back
 and then you know you look at the korean
 cosby and this is another one where
 you know if you if you ignore that 2009
 to
 2011 period it's pretty similar to japan
 you know it's basically been about 30
 plus years
 of pretty much nothing you know and
 especially
 uh the last few years uh and
 korea i mean if you look at korea in 89
 i mean the korean economy as we know it
 doesn't exist at that time
 uh i mean it's it's an incredible
 miracle growth economy
 uh i mean japan was already an advanced
 uh advanced civilization korea was yet
 to
 have its run and in spite of all that
 run the
 the cosby hasn't moved and actually
 korea has a
 quite a cheap market it's a it's a place
 i'm actually
 interested and excited to invest in
 so anyway so that's the
 those are the slides i wanted to share
 and
 and uh so if we uh
 if we if we look at all of this so
 in the year in the year 2000 and i told
 you that
 i had this this really
 terrific growth and learning
 and and you know when i tell you about
 what i learned
 you're gonna say what a dummy you know
 like it took him 26 years to learn this
 stupid stuff
 and uh yeah well you know some of us are
 dense and uh
 it takes uh it takes some time to uh
 learn these lessons so uh
 you know charlie munger says we are
 old too soon and why is too late
 and um but i still feel it's not too
 late you know i mean i'm 56
 hopefully there is uh a good three
 decades
 of compounding ahead so that's that's uh
 if i can get uh
 two and a half or three decades of
 compounding life is great
 um so one of the things that monger has
 mentioned is he said that there's no
 intellectual way a intellectual way to
 defend it but
 he does not sell businesses he owns
 when they get above intrinsic value
 and he won't buy them above intrinsic
 value
 but he won't sell them if they are you
 know somewhat
 above intrinsic value or even even
 reasonably above intrinsic value
 um i think i think uh if it gets too
 egregious egregiously above intrinsic
 value i think he would look at it but
 the berkshire history is that even uh
 even when they looked at for example if
 you look at coke for example
 which in the year 2000 was at you know
 40 plus times earnings
 and it didn't do anything for a long
 time because it was
 quite overvalued uh they haven't touched
 their core position in 32 years
 and my guess would be they wouldn't
 should they won't touch it for
 another few decades um so
 so it'll go on for a while so the one uh
 so when munger says that he's willing to
 hold
 uh whole businesses above intrinsic
 value
 uh that kind of goes against what i'm
 trying to do with the
 you know 50 cents to 90 cents right
 because the two
 are different uh frameworks
 and but when i
 when i studied that some more i realized
 that the the key
 and this is especially true i believe in
 the
 in this period which is i mean so if we
 look at this period
 you know i wish i had made this change
 ideally if i made this change in
 thinking
 about two or three years ago that would
 have been actually i would have hit the
 nail on the head perfectly
 if i had made this because by till 2016
 or so
 the markets really were you know they
 hadn't
 done a whole lot and actually the the
 previous approach
 uh worked really well uh in terms of
 returns and so on
 so i was kind of i think i'm probably
 two or two years or so
 behind but in a in a 26 year
 history uh we can we can be forgiven
 for being a couple of years behind on
 something so that's okay
 so um
 so a few things uh kind of uh
 came together for me this year some of
 you may have looked at a company called
 nvr and nvr is a home builder
 i think in virginia um mid-atlantic and
 so on
 and uh they they have had
 religion related to buybacks
 which has been very intense so from 1994
 till now other than for a couple of
 years in 2008 or 2009 when their
 business was
 upside down they pretty much brought
 back their stock every year
 and and over this period they have spent
 at least 100 percent of owner earnings
 on buybacks and probably over 100
 you know they were they were actually
 even willing to spend uh beyond their
 own earnings on buybacks
 and the nvr business itself if i look at
 it from 2000
 like in the last 20 years you know the
 the top line's gone up
 maybe three four times it hasn't it's
 it's not a company that has any
 intellectual property it's a home
 builder
 um so the top line has gone up three
 four times
 they bought back in the last 20 years 56
 of their shares outstanding over the
 last 26 years i haven't looked at it
 exactly but it's over 80
 it may be approaching 90 of the shares
 outstanding have been
 bought back but in the last 20 years the
 56
 reduction in share count uh the stock
 is up 55 times so
 the company delivered a 55 x return
 in the last 20 years against the
 headwind
 of over overheated index
 and you know that didn't even matter for
 a company like nvr
 and uh so i looked at nvr and then you
 know
 uh i have a i have a
 friend nick sleep uh who's
 who's in the uk and you know nick
 nick had most of his money uh i believe
 when he was running his fund in three
 stocks you know it was
 amazon costco and berkshire and
 uh i think it was in 2015 or so he hung
 up his boots and returned all the
 capital he was running i think he
 returned probably three billion dollars
 or so
 to his investors and basically told them
 that
 in effect i have three stocks uh ten
 years from now i'm going to have these
 three stocks
 uh there's no need for you to pay me
 ridiculous fees just go buy these three
 stocks
 um and of course is institutional
 investors freaked out when they got the
 money back
 i got some calls asking hey we gotta
 mark this money back
 what should we do i said he told you
 what to do
 you know and then they'd say oh our
 mandate doesn't allow us to buy stocks
 so then i said would you like me to set
 up a vehicle
 where i buy those three stocks for you
 and then you can pay me a carry
 you know so uh i mean the life life is
 kind of funny that way
 um but uh but anyway so if you look at
 if you look at nick nick also like like
 charlie
 you know once he finds these great
 compounders um and he's got
 a number of models he's using he's
 he he's looking to let them run and
 looking to let them run for decades
 and and actually in in next portfolio
 it didn't even matter what he owned
 as long as he owned amazon
 so what i'm saying is that the the
 error rate he didn't have much of a
 error rate but even if you're wrong on
 a few of these but you end up with a few
 compounders in the mix
 over a long period of time or a die-hard
 cannibal which has a very stable
 business
 the the results are very non-linear
 so i operated in a very linear
 fashion for the last two decades and
 what i learned
 this year is two or three things
 one as i said one one thing i learned is
 hey monish
 uh we're back to that curve going up
 the flat curve period is over okay
 and and the second is that you can look
 at
 the berkshire examples or the next leaf
 examples a number of other examples you
 can look at
 chuck acree you can look at number of uh
 investors and you'll see that if they've
 held these compounders for long periods
 of time
 uh uh the the results are really good i
 mean it it works out well
 it does it it would not have worked out
 well
 from 2000 to 2015 2016 i think what i
 was doing
 worked a lot better in that period
 because
 if you're buying these compounders at 50
 times earnings
 uh not very many good things are going
 to happen to
 you probably um so so so
 valuation and price matters and it was
 hard to find
 a lot of compounders in 2000. you know
 you could have bought berkshire for
 example
 you'd run fairly well for a few for for
 at least 10 years
 uh but but but for the most part uh
 it was what worked in that period was
 this buy and sell buy and sell
 which is tax inefficient uh but um
 but it it definitely was better than
 holding microsoft
 uh from 2000 2016 for example but
 so so the period we're in right now
 right so
 i'm assuming even though i don't use
 macro
 or anything but what i'm assuming will
 end up happening is what has happened in
 the past
 and what what what with this party
 this party that's underway right now
 will end when we get to extreme euphoria
 and at some point we will get to extreme
 euphoria
 so i don't know if that extreme euphoria
 comes in 2025 or 2030
 uh but let's say somewhere between my
 guess is somewhere between
 the late 2020s and maybe the early 2030s
 is my best guess is when we would get to
 ridiculous valuations again because the
 human memory doesn't go
 back that far and people always say oh
 these companies are different
 they don't have anything to the
 companies in the past so there's no real
 correlation
 but there are correlations so as long as
 humans are
 involved in markets we will go from
 extreme under
 undervaluation to extreme overvaluation
 so if you look at the period
 from 82 to 99
 extreme undervaluation to extreme
 overvaluation
 and then 99 to again 2015 2016
 extreme overvaluation to undervalued and
 then you again
 start going so we we will we will not
 have i don't believe we will have
 these boom and bust periods
 go away i don't know whether they'll be
 you know 17 years long or 30 years long
 or 10 years long we've seen a few
 examples where they go on for different
 periods
 um i mean if you get to extreme binges
 uh you will go for longer periods uh in
 general i think that's true
 uh so i think for me the
 the learnings have been that
 um
 is focus on the compounders um
 the wiring of monish doesn't allow him
 to pay up i'm too cheap to pay up
 right so so i'm i'm stuck in a world
 where i have to buy things fairly cheap
 but but there are you know there's 50
 000 stocks in the world
 there are stocks from time to time which
 are great compounders or great cannibals
 and which do get cheap uh
 periodically so we don't need too many
 of them i mean for the most part
 great compounders are well recognized by
 the world
 and they typically trade at premium
 valuations like they should
 but that's not always the case and so if
 if we can find two or three things
 uh or even even one idea a year which is
 a great compounder or a great cannibal
 or both
 and uh and you know we can get it at a
 reasonable price and then
 you know set it and forget it um
 it's great and so when i look at my
 portfolio today
 it it needs some work to get
 positioned where it needs to be but it's
 on its way i'm actually very happy with
 the way it looks i would i will make a
 few more changes over the next few years
 to get it more
 aligned to where i wanted to be as as
 these ideas show up
 but the framework is is very simple
 that i'm not looking for a 50 cent
 dollar bill
 uh that's not what i'm looking for
 anymore uh what i'm looking for
 is very long runways at very reasonable
 prices
 with a lot of stability so uh with that
 i think we can
 open up for questions comments on this
 subject or whatever else you'd like to
 talk about
 hi sir i want to ask a question um can
 you talk about one
 example of the failure of your
 investment experience that give you the
 most
 divisive impression i mean the figure in
 your
 investment experience there are
 a lot of failures and there's a lot of
 investing mistakes i think that's just
 par for the course
 uh you're not going to be able to go
 through an investing career without
 a number of things that don't work out i
 mean in general
 uh what we're trying to do is we're
 trying to extrapolate deep into the
 future
 and businesses are kind of living
 breathing things and
 they've you know capitalism is brutal
 so there's a lot of competitive forces
 acting on a lot of businesses
 so there's a number of reasons why uh
 things may not work out so if i go back
 and look at
 the the failures or the
 businesses that i've invested in that
 did not work out
 um probably the number one reason why
 a number of investments didn't work out
 was leverage
 so i i had a few zeros
 and a few near zeros uh because
 businesses were uh
 over leveraged and they couldn't handle
 the leverage they had
 so so uh
 i've had a difficult time in financials
 for example
 so in the financial crisis
 in 2008 09 there was a company i owned
 called delta financial
 which was a mortgage lender
 uh went bankrupt went to xero
 i used to own another company called
 compucredit uh
 that didn't go to zero but we had a
 significant loss there
 so i would say that
 probably the area that stands out and
 it's not just me
 when i built my checklist and i looked
 at you know
 what were the business businesses that
 great investors invested in and
 where they didn't work out well uh the
 number one reason
 for the investment not working out was
 leverage
 and uh so um
 i've become a lot more cautious uh
 but i'm still not there in the sense
 that
 i think there are businesses in my
 portfolio which uh which have leverage
 and i wish they had less of it
 but that's definitely a lesson that has
 has been well received question
 um so i'm just wondering when you're
 when you're valuing
 valuing a company what are the most
 important criteria or metrics you use
 in determining its intrinsic value
 it bends um
 it depends on the business uh so it's
 you know i think different industries
 and different companies
 uh you you have to use uh
 different different yardsticks so
 like for example you know
 i used to own a company in china
 uh called maotai which makes a
 premium liquor and um
 it's a business i should have held on to
 but in my infinite wisdom i sold
 because of the 50 90 uh and such but uh
 i think mao tai went up over a
 four or five year period about six seven
 times
 um and uh you know that's a business
 where
 the cost of the product is i mean the
 bottle a bottle of
 the amount i buy you is maybe their cost
 is
 three four dollars and it goes for like
 150 dollars
 you know anytime you have a business
 like that you're going to do really well
 and the 150 dollars in a few years can
 be 300
 um because they've they've got this
 incredible brand and
 um you know there's
 a massive growth of china backdrop and
 it's a it's a status symbol to be able
 to serve maokai and so on
 so so when you're val when you're
 looking at a business like that
 uh it's going to be quite a different
 analysis than for example when i looked
 at uh
 another business we owned i think in
 2012 we bought fiat chrysler
 uh and so there uh the calculus was
 very different you know so there we had
 a
 uh star manager uh you know the business
 that was doing 130 plus billion in
 revenue
 and a five six billion dollar market cap
 and uh
 you know pretty much um
 if they were able to just even slightly
 right the ship
 uh and even you know
 eek out two three percent four percent
 in profits
 that stock was going to be a
 multi-bagger multibagger
 so you know the it just depends each
 each business and each industry
 um i think you have to just and and the
 key is that you have to get to
 you have to get to the factors that
 matter
 you know like i would say that if you
 look at a
 if you look at a company like nvr and
 every year they are
 taking 100 of owner earnings and putting
 it into buybacks
 um and you you continue to own the stock
 those earnings are not coming to you
 okay
 you're you're you're owning a bigger and
 bigger portion of the pie
 but you're not seeing any cash come to
 you right
 and so in that case the the
 the thing that matters uh all that
 matters when you own a business like
 that
 is that whatever endpoint you want to
 look at
 the question is what are the shares
 outstanding
 at that end point and what are the what
 is the stability and cash flow of the
 business at that point
 uh because that's how the market would
 value it right so so
 um so it's a different
 it's a very different catalyst for multi
 it's a very
 different calculus from fiat chrysler so
 each business that you're looking at i
 think you you need to look at
 so the first question even when you get
 before you get to all those things is
 is um do i understand the business
 is it within my circle of competence can
 i figure out the two or three variables
 that really matter so for example one of
 the things about the
 nvr home building business is
 they don't start building a home
 till there's already a person who's
 bought it
 okay so they don't build any speculative
 homes so
 i go to them and say i look at the model
 and say yeah that's great
 i'll buy the home we sign a contract
 they see i have a bank loan
 and that's when they start building the
 that home
 so which means that they're
 they do not put any capital in
 till there's a confirmed sale right and
 the second thing about nvr is nvr does
 not
 own land which is the biggest investment
 for a lot of builders they have options
 on land
 so they typically basically believe in
 just in time
 manufacturing where they're saying all
 the factors of production that i need
 to build this home i want to be
 bringing those together as close to the
 sale point
 as possible so when you when you look at
 a business like that what that means is
 that if the business ebbs and flows
 which is the
 number of homes they build goes up and
 down with the economy
 and so on it doesn't really matter
 as long as their core overheads are low
 okay so let's say for example
 their you know their corporate overhead
 whatever if they built
 zero homes in a year is 25 million
 dollars for example
 right um so if they didn't build any
 homes they would lose 25 million
 for example and if you can see that the
 balance sheet can handle that for
 several years
 uh then you're fine then you know that
 and you know that if they build
 more than a thousand homes
 they'll make money more than 500 homes
 they'll make money you know you figure
 out the metric
 at what point they break even and maybe
 they're building
 5000 homes a year and
 you know the number of homes they build
 typically
 uh fluctuates between five thousand i'm
 just pulling these numbers out and i'm
 not i'm not
 uh nvr is a train according to me that
 left that
 left the station uh but who knows maybe
 in the next 20 years they'll prove me
 wrong
 where they'll buy back another nine
 percent of their talk and be one percent
 shares outstanding um so
 uh anyway what i'm trying to say is that
 each business
 uh is completely different and so the
 key is can you understand the two or
 three variables
 that are going to drive the outcome and
 it's very important that you've honed in
 on those
 key variables then usually
 the entrepreneur or the ceo running the
 businesses
 needs to be honed in on the same
 variables so if
 you have gotten to the point where you
 can
 see the business and visualize it the
 way the ceo does
 then it's typically that you've got the
 right variables so much for being here
 um in dondo investor you advise the
 reader to look for
 low risk high uncertainty businesses and
 i thought that was a
 fascinating construct
 but also last year in this class watch
 the recording and you mentioned that you
 hate retail
 i'd be curious if you could go a little
 bit more into that
 analysis and kind of how you see the
 retail landscape
 let's say over the next decade or two
 and then maybe if you could tie that in
 with your observation about
 this period that you see going until
 perhaps the late uh 2020s early 2030s
 but specifically you know how that low
 risk high uncertainty formulation
 links to how you see retail right now
 you know um i hate retail
 and arvind loves retail so if you ever
 want the other point of view on why
 retail is awesome
 uh you should talk to arvind um
 but uh yeah i've never i've never liked
 i've never liked retail and one of the
 things about investing is
 this morning i was on a bike ride with
 uh
 uh another money manager uh and uh
 you know he was saying to me that he
 really doesn't get
 these restaurants like he doesn't get
 burger king he doesn't get
 um you know dominoes and so on
 and i try to explain some of those
 businesses to him
 you know makes the bike ride go quickly
 but i also told him
 i said you can have a very very happy
 life
 never ever understanding
 what makes these like like he was his
 complaint to me was
 that he can understand starbucks really
 well
 okay and he he understands that the
 substitution
 options on starbucks for most humans
 is pretty limited like if you get to a
 routine you know nowadays we don't go to
 work or whatever we get to a routine
 you know you're not going to be
 switching your coffee
 uh every day to a different place or
 whatever right you get to a routine
 but you may change the place you have
 lunch every day
 okay so the recurrence of starbucks
 and the recurrence of chipotle are not
 the same
 so that's i'm just telling you what so
 his perspective was that if i look at
 wendy's
 you know there's so many options besides
 wendy's when you go to eat
 right and so so i told him listen
 whether that framework is correct or
 wrong
 in terms of taking about pass on wendy's
 it doesn't matter all that matters is
 what you do invest in
 so if you unfairly get rid of wendy's
 because it might be a good business
 because 90 plus percent franchise and
 all that stuff
 and they just introduced breakfast and
 so on um
 no issues so we're in a business of no
 call strikes
 okay so you can take entire
 industries and say i'm not interested
 and no there's no penalty so i have
 taken
 this entire industry of retail and
 in one big lump just dumped it on the
 side
 um and we have arvind on the other hand
 who's
 pouring through each one okay and i
 don't even want to pour through each one
 i don't think the whole
 chunk can just get rid of it as quickly
 as possible in fact
 even now i don't understand amazon's
 retail business
 i don't understand because i say that
 the last mile is so expensive
 you know like if i order like a seven
 dollar item
 they deliver to my doorstep the cost of
 that has to be like
 10 bucks 15 bucks just to get it to my
 door i mean
 all the things you have to go through um
 but somehow amazon makes money and and
 it probably works because not everything
 i order will be seven dollars and so on
 and so
 statistically probably works out but the
 thing is that i don't get it right
 and so if i don't get it it doesn't
 matter just let it go
 so retail the problem with retail
 traditional retail you know brick and
 mortar retail is
 it's the most transparent of businesses
 and sam walton took advantage of that
 so sam walton spent an incredible amount
 of time
 in his competitor's stores and
 he would constantly i mean he would go
 to any town any place he was going he'd
 always take his team
 into and it didn't even need to be the
 big guys he would go to little stores
 big stores
 he was going all over the world right so
 one time
 uh in brazil there's a supermarket
 and some old guys flat on the ground and
 they call the paramedics
 okay and then they find out it's sam
 walton and
 he wanted to measure the the space
 between
 aisles and he didn't have a tape measure
 so he said i'll use my body
 because i know how tall i am and so but
 what i'm saying he was fanatical
 about the inches between the aisles okay
 so every minor thing
 and so the problem in retail is that
 there are no trade secrets okay
 every single thing that you're doing
 your competitors can just walk in
 and get everything the second problem is
 so if i look at a business like
 let's say business like adp you know
 payroll processing
 how frequently do businesses change
 their payroll processor let me just tell
 you
 i hate adp i use adp
 i hate them why do i hate them i look at
 all the costs i'm paying
 and i'm saying it's ridiculous you know
 it's a bunch of digital stuff they're
 doing
 and why do they charge me so much so i
 every few years i
 look to get out of adp
 okay and then i figure out that yeah i
 can do it middle of the year
 and whatever they'll give to w-2s and
 all that
 but really for the employees what is
 seamless is to do it just once
 at the end of the year right so it's
 it's simpler
 so your switching is limited like one
 day
 okay and then the other guy i talked to
 paychecks
 there's no difference i i talk to the
 paychecks guy and i'm not getting any
 special deal then i go to like
 you know smaller guys and then so in the
 end i'm back to edp
 okay and uh adp has something very
 important
 in my opinion one of the most important
 things in business
 is rrs
 rrs recurring revenue streams
 okay so recurring revenue streams rrs by
 the way i made up
 okay it's an acronym i just made up okay
 so
 recurring revenue streams is the holy
 grail what we want in a business
 we want franchises which are just
 pounding the reason retail is such a
 massive graveyard of all these companies
 going under
 is because the customer has no contract
 with you
 okay so i go to a kmart and if for
 whatever reason i'm not very happy with
 something or the other or someone else
 offers something on sale
 i don't need any obligation to go to
 them i can go to someone else
 it's totally different from adp i mean
 adp they've got you they've got another
 business there which is
 uh automating these uh auto dealerships
 you know every time you go to auto
 dealer
 and they pull up and they give you your
 uh you know yours either your sale
 contract
 or your maintenance stuff all that is
 running on a
 i think it's fun of that company but
 they're all based on adb all of these
 businesses
 that adp had with these recurring
 revenue businesses
 and so those businesses have another one
 that they spun out
 uh broadridge uh you know which sent out
 all the filings uh
 all these companies the public companies
 that we send out to the investors and
 all that
 so broadridge gets paid
 x per investor whether they send it
 digitally on
 in the mail okay what does it cost them
 to send some digitally
 zero okay approaching zero but they
 still charge it's a great business
 so what i'm trying to say is that retail
 most retail
 doesn't have those attributes okay now
 there are retailers so for example when
 i take this whole
 industry and dump it what happens is
 when i dump the industry part of the
 dumping includes costco
 okay and part of the dumping includes
 amazon
 okay and then you look or even walmart i
 dump all of them
 right and then i look at the stock chart
 on these and it looks great
 you know and so but you know the thing
 is
 i just find that even look at walmart i
 say it's it's a business that does
 well but they need to be so
 good costco needs to be so good now
 costco
 has so much goodwill with its customers
 and
 so much that they do for their customers
 that that mode
 is very solid you know finally i
 i think i understand costco's mode but i
 understand it at 40 times earnings i did
 not understand it at eight times
 earnings or whatever
 right so it's okay that train has left
 the station
 no problem there are a million trains
 yet to come
 so what i find is that when i look at
 these businesses home depot and costco
 and
 walmart and all this stuff they are very
 good businesses
 but what is hidden beneath the surface
 is these businesses require incredible
 execution
 and they have to every day win back
 the loyalty of their customers uh
 because you know there's constant
 erosion taking place
 from new entrants right i mean amazon
 comes in and no matter how well walmart
 executes
 they've got it's a paradigm shift and
 and it's difficult so walmart has to
 kind of
 change the way it is so i think i think
 retail is
 is i find very hard and
 so in general i'm not interested and and
 actually you know one of the things is
 if you look at
 if you look at someone like buffett and
 look at something like berkshire
 hathaway
 berkshire hathaway has made lots of
 retail investments
 okay they bought many many jewelers
 and they bought many many furniture guys
 okay now if you look at warren's track
 record when he invests in financials
 or when you invest in banks or anything
 like that it's a
 it's he's batting a thousand it's a
 flawless record he
 just i don't i've never seen him lose
 money
 investing in a bank he's really really
 good at it
 uh but uh in retail
 uh berkshire i mean they don't talk
 about it because
 he doesn't want to you know
 have the managers loot or lose all
 motivation uh
 but it's a graveyard basically i think
 every
 furniture operation they bought other
 than nebraska furniture mart
 did not work every jewelry operation
 they bought
 other than borsheims did not work and on
 and on so they made
 they made a lot of forays into retail
 and by and large they didn't work now it
 didn't matter to berkshire because
 by and large they've been small relative
 to the size of berkshire
 and they carry a lot of those businesses
 and it's okay
 uh but it didn't work so well to clarify
 manisha's reference to my retail love is
 really a costco
 love so i don't want oh i think irwin
 that goes beyond costco
 costco costco is like a torrid affair
 okay costco is not just an affair to
 costco has like gone off the charts but
 the others are still there
 costco there's still some love with the
 others
 costco is more like my wife there's just
 my wife
 and i make sure she can't hear that
 i don't know i don't know i do not
 appreciate that
 being inflated to costco
 [Laughter]
 i think she may love costco
 thank you for being here um as a south
 asian immigrant obviously i enjoyed
 uh the dundo investor so thanks again
 i was curious you mentioned earlier in
 your remarks you know 50
 000 stocks you clearly have breadth
 across geography and industries and
 business models
 where do you start so what is top of
 funnel for you
 especially since it seems like with the
 50 cent and exited 90 cent strategy
 you have far more velocity and sort of
 your portfolio
 than many other value investors i've
 sort of read about and
 spoken with well hopefully that velocity
 is going to zero soon
 um that's where we want to get to uh
 you know so when buffett is asked that
 question
 he says start with the a's
 okay but i'll try to give you a better
 answer than warren
 um so uh there are some hacks
 so 50 000 stocks is a lot and and
 actually when warren says start with the
 a's he's not kidding
 because he went through the moody's
 manual
 you know every page and you know the
 movies manual they stopped publishing
 that
 several decades ago so i bought a few of
 those on ebay just to get a
 feel for you know what the messiah used
 and yeah
 it's pretty dense stuff i mean got like
 four or five businesses per page
 a very small fine print and he went
 through all that um
 and and so his and uh
 lilu's done the same thing so definitely
 uh you can put your nose to the
 grindstone and you can start pounding
 through these businesses
 uh and you know i tried to get
 warren interested in capital iq
 you know i said warren you know you one
 time i was in his office and he was
 going through the japan company handbook
 and i said warren you know if we if we
 get you to splurge on capital iq you can
 run screens and this and that and
 i even got to showing
 uh one of his assistants kind of you
 know how to do all that and everything
 and
 he's not going to spend that money he
 wants his 50
 book and that's what all he wants um so
 anyway and it's worked just fine for him
 but but you can hack this a little bit
 so
 one one way i hack it is you can look at
 what other great investors have bought
 okay so you can make a list of uh
 investors and
 it's interesting to actually uh
 categorize them so
 if you look at someone like chuck akri
 you'll see a certain pattern to what he
 buys
 you look at david tepper you see some
 different patterns or
 you look at you know you know jeff urban
 and so on so you can you can find
 different
 patterns with the different investors
 and you know dataroma does a good job of
 giving you a whole bunch of investors
 and what they own
 such pretty easily the price is right
 it's zero
 um so that can take that fifty thousand
 share uh the the 50 000 stocks
 down by more than 90
 maybe even 98 okay
 and and then the the second the second
 hack you can do
 is uh you know the first question i ask
 myself when i look at a business is
 is it within circular competence you
 know so you can winnow that
 list down different ways um you could
 run screens for
 you know low p's or whatever but i think
 that
 looking at what other great investors
 are one of the good is a good filter
 um because already gone through one
 filter especially if they're larger
 holdings
 uh then the second question you ask to
 ask yourself is is it within circle of
 competence
 and that will take out quite a few
 businesses as well
 so and then you know if you do if you're
 like me like you know
 anything retail gone you know anything
 financial is gone
 right you just have these um you know
 anything pharma gone healthcare gone you
 know all of that so i
 i can take out um a lot of stuff
 relatively quickly
 and it doesn't matter if i'm doing this
 mass
 stuff and there's good stuff going away
 there's not there's no penalty for that
 uh this infinite amount of good stuff so
 you can keep throwing away a lot of
 stuff
 and and then you get down to uh
 some things that you know strike your
 fancy or
 you get interested in and then you go
 deep
 feel free to jump in i saw vishal rusty
 sam
 all had questions um sorry to take us
 back a couple
 questions but uh to kind of piggyback
 off what
 frank had mentioned as far as valuations
 a lot of your investments
 are emerging markets overseas where
 accounting standards aren't exactly
 aren't exactly a thing
 management may be a little bit more
 difficult to get in touch with
 so what sort of extra legwork do you
 have to go through in order to make
 your investments and arrive at an
 investment decision
 i think most of the international stuff
 i think
 i've i've usually had to go see the
 business
 and kick the tires and assess the
 management
 and so on so it's uh it's definitely
 involved more work but it's a lot of fun
 work actually i enjoy that
 so yeah you you do have a few more
 layers to peel
 as you go from i mean one of the things
 i don't have to worry too much about is
 that
 um i think the odds that i would lose
 odds that i would lose money in the u.s
 on an investment
 because of fraud uh approach zero
 we you know they make the headlines here
 and there
 the enrons and stuff but the odds that
 something like that
 enters your portfolio is very low
 especially if you're then
 doing research and work on it and you
 understand the business you know i think
 something like enron would be just
 beyond my understanding you know so
 a pretty easy pass you know if i can
 understand
 amazon you know enron is very far from
 that
 so so basically i think
 uh yeah you you have a little more work
 to do
 but you also have more rewards in the
 sense that sometimes the tailwinds can
 be a lot stronger
 uh and and i think i think that uh
 you know i think in general
 entrepreneurs around the world um
 you know most of them are trying to
 uh you know make a go at it fairly
 honestly
 um i think that's a that's a general
 trade across and
 uh and yeah you do have to kind of
 check that box and test it a little
 carefully
 but you can get there not a problem i
 can go um
 manish thank you so much for doing this
 this is so much fun
 so far um my uh i have two quick
 questions for you
 uh you mentioned earlier that you've
 learned a lot
 during this pandemic i was just curious
 to
 um learn more about like how you managed
 your portfolio during the pandemic or
 managing your portfolio
 and what have you learned so far uh and
 my second
 question is um so we had
 someone from fidelity last week and uh
 um the portfolio manager told us that a
 lot of
 people currently are investing in growth
 um
 i'm just wondering if value investing is
 dead
 uh or is it that uh like do you still
 believe that
 uh value investing has uh a place
 uh today i think uh yeah i think
 uh regarding the pandemic so a couple of
 things
 i mean i think in the march time frame
 when this data was kind of coming out
 about you know kind of how big this was
 going to be
 and the shutdowns were starting and so
 on
 uh i was trying to understand kind of
 you know
 what kind of impacts it would have on
 the existing portfolio
 so the thing is that capitalism is very
 brutal
 and in the best of times
 most businesses are very fragile um
 so they most businesses cannot withstand
 uh the kind of shock uh of
 these shutdowns and stuff most
 businesses cannot handle that
 it's um it's it's really hard
 and so for example but i think when i
 looked at
 my portfolio um
 you know like for example i i own some
 real estate companies in india so these
 businesses they don't have much leverage
 their sales velocity was going to go
 down but i didn't have any concern about
 stability of the business i said yeah
 you know they'll have less sales and
 they've got some
 like explained nvr they've got some
 corporate overhead
 and can they handle that i said yeah
 that's not a problem for them to handle
 the overhead
 so i was not concerned about those
 businesses
 um i uh i i got
 quite concerned about one of our
 companies you know fiat chrysler
 uh because the the car business is so
 much operating leverage
 and uh and and when you shut down a car
 plant
 uh i mean it's you've taken that whole
 thing in reverse
 so i actually could not see
 i was very concerned about how this is
 going to
 affect them how long it's going to last
 etc
 and so we completely exited
 the position um and i exited at
 a significant discount to where it was
 trading
 before uh the pandemic and even now i
 mean it's
 it's come back in a manner that was
 different from the way i expected so if
 i had done nothing i would have been
 better off but i couldn't see it it was
 the uncertainty levels are way too high
 and i had seen that business have
 trouble
 uh in the past so we didn't take a lot
 of actions
 in the portfolio we took some actions um
 but on the flip side what also happened
 at that time was
 there were great opportunities uh so
 especially in march
 you know towards the end of march when
 the markets were tanking
 um we were able to put
 money to work and uh so i made two
 investments and uh
 they done very well so and i'm very
 happy that we made those so
 uh so the pandemic i think is uh
 is now i think we it's a little bit more
 there's more clarity about it and
 it's still going to last for quite a
 while i think that it'll take a while
 because uh we need to get to the point
 where
 um in effect people have
 some kind of certificate or passport or
 something which
 says i'm vaccinated and whatever and
 and such and and you know for business
 to come back and business
 people to have meetings everyone needs
 to have that sort of thing
 uh in place so that will take a while
 and so i think uh
 but we are already finding in california
 for example the
 the freeways are getting clogged up and
 you know so things things are coming
 if they have nots um i mean this is this
 is really stressed they have not since
 really
 unfortunately widened the gap between
 the haves and have-nots it's a very
 uh sad thing in terms of what's happened
 with the pandemic in terms of
 who it's impacted uh growth and value
 are joined at the hip
 there's no difference all
 intelligent investing is value investing
 so
 if a company is growing all that means
 is that you've got more
 coupons in the future and they've got
 higher coupons and then you discount
 them
 to whatever rate so it doesn't matter
 whether those coupons are growing at 20
 a year
 or they're growing at zero percent a
 year or they're declining five percent a
 year
 all three cases will give you a
 valuation on which
 uh you can invest you're better off
 having high return on equity and high
 growth
 in general that's really what's gonna
 uh and long runways with that but i
 don't particularly see it
 as one is different from the other
 i think if you if i have a choice
 i want to invest in growth
 and and anyway i i told you that you
 know the
 50 to 90 cents is not of as much
 interest
 i want to get to the long runways and
 such so
 um but i want to get to the wrong
 runways without paying up too much
 so thank you for uh for joining us today
 um my question for you uh relates to one
 of the points that you
 made in your book that when i read it a
 couple years ago i thought was really
 brilliant which is that
 embedded options tend to be mispriced
 um since i read that you know it's
 something i've been on the lookout for
 uh for a few years now and one of the
 things that i've observed
 is that uh actually these things tend to
 be understood
 at least in the businesses that i've
 looked at so i'm wondering whether you
 think
 um that's a concept that now tends to be
 more widely understood by the markets or
 whether
 you still find options that are in fact
 mispriced
 you're you're talking of the optionality
 in a business in a business right
 exactly i mean i think i think that that
 persists
 um always i mean uh
 markets markets uh don't
 like um these kind of
 wide outcome ranges you know i i think
 what what markets are really good as
 they want to see a cookie cutter
 and they want to be able to see uh you
 know what that cookie cutter can do over
 a long period of time
 and they want a straight line right so
 if i have a business like costco uh you
 know that gets
 as much as like a cookie cutter as you
 can imagine right they they have a
 pretty well-defined model they do
 innovate within that model but
 they know the path they're going down
 and i mean i would say
 um optionality on costco would be like
 you know they're
 in such a small number of countries
 uh they could expand that quite
 dramatically
 china just started for them um
 and so on but you know uh it's also
 richly priced so
 uh i think that i find
 that what markets don't appreciate
 because most markets participants
 did not run businesses or have not run
 businesses
 is they don't appreciate the messiness
 of the real world
 and they don't like the messiness of the
 real world and so that actually gives
 an advantage to an investor who
 appreciates that
 so the reality we know in businesses is
 that things don't go in a straight line
 and that you're going to have ups and
 downs and
 that businesses will open
 up brand new things that you never
 imagined
 you know was not part of the model like
 starbucks starts
 reserve right so they're going to go
 higher end on the coffee
 or even starts uh serving alcohol
 for example you know so those if those
 kind of
 tangents work it changes the paradigm
 but the market's not willing to
 recognize those typically uh because
 they see a lot of uncertainty with those
 so yes
 uh if you can if you can figure out
 uh optionality of the business and you
 can handicap the probabilities
 uh of the optionality or you're not
 paying for it at all you know
 you're paying for the core business
 you're not paying for the optionality
 uh then those those can be really good
 absolutely
 um like one of the things i didn't i
 didn't appreciate but
 came out later was that like when we
 bought
 fiat chrysler for example in 2012
 i was just looking at this as a
 a car business with a great ceo
 who was going to right the ship and if
 you right to the ship they would make a
 few billion dollars a year
 and the market cap would go to four or
 five times
 what it was what i did not appreciate
 about
 about fear chrysler was that
 i knew that for example ferrari was
 embedded inside the company
 but at that time when i made the
 investment ferrari was making
 less than 150 million a year
 and i said okay you know well you know
 you can give this a 15 multiple or
 something and
 you know it's it's got maybe a couple of
 billion of value or something but
 it's not going to what i was looking at
 is that
 can this 5 6 billion get to 30 billion
 for example right and i could see that
 the core business could get to that
 right but
 i just dis dismissed ferrari
 and uh and as it turned out i mean
 uh that that ferrari portion
 uh that we we in effect
 paid um when i bought the thing
 we paid about 16
 a share for ferrari inside fiat chrysler
 and it went to 200 you know 190 or 200
 right
 and uh so and and it was one third
 eventually got one third of the value so
 uh it
 it did way better than the rest of the
 other pieces
 and then they had a they had a parts
 that they had several parts businesses
 which they got rid of and spun out and
 so on so there was a lot of stuff that
 came out of
 fiat chrysler which was not part of my
 original analysis
 and i just said okay you know we've got
 a gifted manager
 and he's going to make sure that we get
 good value from these pieces so the
 optionality there
 was not even something i was focused on
 but then i after a few years i realized
 there's a lot of different pieces here
 that i haven't accounted for
 and that worked out very good so i was
 wondering
 um you've talked about long runways and
 i was just wondering
 how do you find long runways and where
 do you see long runways
 forward on long runways is arvind
 that's what you need to do you need to
 put your arms around irvine then ask him
 uh he's hard to do that in a coveted
 world
 he's he's a mr long runway guy it's his
 full name is
 arvind long runway navaratram you know
 it's a middle name um i mean i think
 i think that
 it's a really good question and i think
 the
 the best way i can answer that is that
 um if you
 if you make 10 bets
 or you know carefully selected all with
 long runway that leads your perception
 that they have long runway so one of the
 problems with long runways is that
 you know i already told you capitalism
 is very brutal you know i mean there's
 all these forces
 coming from left field and center and
 everywhere else
 trying to chip away at any competitive
 advantage right
 so people look at people look at adp
 and they look at that incredible moat
 and they want to constantly hammer
 against that move
 or people look at visa and mastercard
 and look at that mode and they want to
 go
 keep going against that mode and
 many times they will succeed they will
 succeed at
 collapsing that mode that's the nature
 of i mean
 if you look at you know dominant
 businesses 50 years ago
 100 years ago even 30 years ago
 how many of those are dominant today you
 know i mean
 most most have gone by the wayside
 uh because capitalism is really hard but
 if you if you if you make
 eight or ten bets and you know you're
 careful on the valuation what you're
 willing to pay
 and you are convinced that the modes are
 quite resilient
 even if you're wrong 40 of the time
 you will still end up very wealthy
 um so you're not going to bat
 a hundred percent on the long runway
 game
 i mean look at look at uh warren and
 charlie
 all they're doing is trying to buy long
 runways but if you looked at
 every acquisition berkshire has made and
 you equal weight every acquisition
 i would say easily a third have not
 worked
 right now if you dollar weight probably
 80 90 percent have worked
 but if you equal weighted a lot of the
 decisions
 didn't work and these are the gods of
 investing
 right so so we're gonna have mistakes
 we're going to have
 things that we think are going to work
 and they won't work
 but if you i mean bottom line is that
 if you make 10 bets and
 each one is 10 percent and
 one of them becomes a thirty bagger
 and you know three or four go by the
 wayside and some of them are you know
 five or ten baggers over a
 20 30 year period you'll do just fine
 so i have a question uh kind of on that
 topic about moats
 um when you're assessing moats is it
 more
 uh conceptually or do you do it um more
 analytically and how confident in uh in
 a moat
 do you have to be to ultimately invest
 in that company
 it should be very obvious to you
 i think you should be able to look at it
 and and you should have very high degree
 so
 i mean let's say let's say we look at a
 business
 like starbucks right so i mean if you
 were investing in starbucks the big
 question is that
 you know what does this company look
 like 20 years from now
 or 10 years from now you know is the
 mote intact are people still going in
 who are their competitors at that point
 i mean these are the questions you need
 to answer
 you know how big the runway is how far
 they can go
 what can happen and there's a you know
 there's a range of outcomes but
 you need to be convinced
 probabilistically that
 most of that is skewed towards a great
 answer
 um and if you look at if you look at a
 business like
 chipotle for example you know a lot of
 people will look at chipotle and say you
 know
 you know what's the difference between
 chipotle and some you know taco stand
 somewhere
 and i think there's a difference i think
 there's a big difference between
 most almost all mexican restaurants and
 chipotle
 uh and they've in my opinion they've
 widened and deepened the moat i mean
 in their app is great they've
 in the pandemic done a really good job
 with
 keeping the business profitable with
 deliveries and
 you know all of that i mean the dining
 rooms are shut down but they've been
 able to survive all that
 and and the infinite
 customization you can do on it so
 there's a number of things there but
 again the question would be you know
 when you look out 10 years
 15 years what does that business look
 like you know
 does it it does it become chipotle's all
 over europe
 all over asia all over latin america is
 that does that happen
 what are the probabilities that are
 happening who else have
 entered the space will they keep
 executing you know
 what will be their ros in the future or
 there's a whole bunch of things that
 come up so i think what i'm saying is
 that
 you've got to start out with admiring
 the business and the more like you've
 got to intrinsically know that
 like even before i look at any adp
 numbers i know it's a great business
 okay even before i look at any visa
 numbers i know it's a great business
 right uh so first thing is you've got to
 mentally have a kind of framework in
 your head
 that tells you yes i i
 like this business and i think it's
 great um
 uh i think that businesses like chipotle
 are harder because they don't have
 recurring revenue and all these things i
 think
 some businesses like adp may have more
 resilience because even if there's a
 disrupter
 businesses are not going to be
 wanting to change payroll quickly
 because it's such a small portion of
 their costs
 like i mean for me that you know messing
 around with payroll
 makes no economic sense okay
 it just irritates me so i go down these
 you know irrational paths
 but basically for most businesses it's
 not worth the time of day
 it's payroll is running fine leave it
 alone right
 and so so those businesses have a much
 higher degree of resilience in my
 opinion
 than a chipotle right because there
 you've got to keep earning the customers
 uh confidence and trust every day and
 and so on so i think uh
 mods come in so many wide widely
 different shapes and sizes
 and you know all kinds of things happen
 you know boeing
 what an incredible moat and then
 all hell breaks loose you know so
 um i mean if you looked at boeing three
 or four years ago
 you would say this is unbelievable
 they've got this huge pipeline
 they don't produce a white tail i mean
 just like
 nvr doesn't produce a home that's not
 already sold
 boeing doesn't produce an airplane that
 isn't already sold
 right so there's no whitetails and
 they've got a big order book
 and they're a duopoly
 and you know and they've got a great
 defense business and all that it's just
 it's an incredible business but
 look where we are you know so such is
 life
 so thanks for being here too it's it's
 really great to have you here
 um my question is more on the
 on the selling side um
 [Music]
 you talk about you talked earlier about
 uh the fifty to ninety percent
 and you sell at ninety percent
 interesting value now we're talking
 about long
 runways but you keep on looking for new
 business opportunities i'm sure as well
 at one point do you say you know what i
 thought this was a good business
 i think it has has good growth
 opportunities but you know i got this
 business here that i'm looking at it
 looks like it's more valuable how do you
 how do you go about this
 part it's probably selling off i don't
 know how you do it but
 do you sell good good positions for what
 you think might be even better
 yeah it's all it's all opportunity cost
 i think those are
 those are why you get paid the big bucks
 i think that's
 you have to continuously do that uh but
 you but you know it's a
 it's a difficult exercise because the
 mistress
 always looks harder than the wife
 you know and actually the wife may be
 hotter but you think the mistress is
 harder
 you know so you've got to make sure that
 the mistress is actually harder
 not just that you think it's that way
 so anything that we know really well
 we also know all the blemishes really
 well
 right and this new shiny thing on the
 side
 we don't know all the blemishes yet you
 know so that's one of the things is that
 the
 greater your familiarity with the
 business
 um the greater your familiarity is going
 to be with all the
 like like you know arvin's probably
 really really familiar with all the
 negative
 issues with costco okay he knows those
 really well
 uh even i mean i don't even i can't
 believe costco has anything negative but
 whatever negative there is are winds
 away
 uh i'm sorry what long lines
 oh yeah long lines yeah yeah you know
 like every time i pass
 a costco gas station i think i'm in some
 socialist country
 you know i think i'm in russia 30 years
 ago or something
 you know i think why in a capitalist
 society
 do we have these long lines for gas you
 know but that's the way it is such as
 life
 um yeah so i think you have to be
 careful
 that you don't fall into the mistress
 trap
 and uh as long as uh you are genuinely
 looking at something that is better than
 what you own
 better value than what you own and and
 you know you consider the tax
 implications and all of that
 uh you know my i have a good friend
 guy spear and
 [Music]
 another friend of mine the way he
 describes guy is he says he has the
 highest return of any investor on the
 planet
 based on effort expended
 okay on on on every hour
 of effort expended guy is off the charts
 okay uh so the thing with guy
 is that any time and i bounce a lot of
 ideas off him anytime i bring up
 any new idea to him
 it doesn't matter how good it is
 he is not changing anything
 so i tell him guy listen you've got
 nestle okay nestle is done
 okay 30 40 times earnings whatever done
 okay we've got this thing at three times
 earnings which has got this massive
 runway
 can we please sell nestle please and i
 get nowhere
 he's not willing to make
 any changes okay and then after i keep
 badgering him over and over and over
 uh he'll buy two percent okay and uh
 and and that's it you know and uh uh
 like you know uh i mean he loves
 long runways okay he loves deep modes
 he loves all these things so
 i told him about mao tai
 okay i mean great brand blah blah blah
 also i said this is it guy i know you
 don't like all the i bring to you
 but this is like a real runway
 he says i'm not buying any chinese
 company
 i'm not going i said it's fine there's
 no issues there
 fifty percent payout all this stuff good
 governance blah blah okay
 he's i'm not going there okay and then i
 kept badgering him
 and i think he put like a hundred
 thousand dollars into it just to get me
 off
 his back and then after a few years
 we went to china together and we visited
 maotai headquarters and then he says
 and you know by that time it's now gone
 up about five times
 and then the whole trip was oh i missed
 this
 oh i should have bought this i said do
 you remember
 do you remember all the calls i made and
 i was pounding pounding and i couldn't
 get through
 oh yeah i don't know what it was
 happening this is such a no-brainer this
 is so easy blah blah blah
 you know so but what but you know
 actually in action
 in action is what saves sky
 so the best thing that you can do
 is don't make switches if it's 60 40.
 don't make switches if it's you know
 this is a little bit better
 and i'll make the switch no make the
 switch
 hurdle really high like the mistress has
 to be
 really really hot okay not
 just better than the wife okay they're
 all better than the wife
 but really hot and then you're fine
 [Music]
 about competitive advantages um so you
 have a role of only investing in
 copycats
 as opposed to innovators um so my
 question is do you believe that there's
 a first mover advantage
 that's a really good question um
 so i think that one of the mental models
 which has served me really well and it's
 a weird
 it's a weird uh nuance of humans
 and i still don't understand why humans
 are this way but they are this way
 humans are bad at
 cloning and copying
 most humans and most companies
 almost think that it's beneath them um
 they somehow think it's kind of uh you
 know
 so and so what that does is it opens up
 a significant window
 of opportunities that would not exist
 without it so
 obviously we are right on the innovators
 and the innovators you know grow and
 scale and whatever
 we do really well i mean you know uh uh
 but
 but if you if you uh
 so if we look at a company like uh
 microsoft for example um
 microsoft is the ultimate cloner okay
 um after they came up with the basic
 compiler compiler in 1976 in
 new mexico everything has been copied or
 stolen
 from then on and they're not even very
 good at cloning
 like you know uh when they try to clone
 the mac
 it took them like 15 years and 10
 versions to get
 get there you know and uh so um
 excel was copied from lotus
 and word was copied from word perfect uh
 powerpoint was acquired
 you know access copied oracle and
 sybase and uh you know
 um um
 you know they finally gave up on
 search and they kind of you know went
 with google but
 you know the acronym uh for bing
 is but it's not google you know
 so they they not only they're they're
 not a good cloner they
 many times they fail like forever they
 tried to
 clone quicken and they came out with
 money
 and they were never able to get traction
 there they put a lot of effort into
 search
 they could never get traction there um
 so
 even with being a bad cloner you know
 like for example now
 uh microsoft has teams right
 and teams copied uh slate right
 and uh and uh and they will
 probably you know kill slate uh because
 they're such good they're so good at
 uh eventually getting these things
 working and then eventually the
 incumbent uh has a problem uh
 if you look at something about someone
 like uh walmart
 um for more than 10 or 15 years after
 after sam walton founded walmart
 for at least the first 15 years there
 was no innovation
 every single thing about walmart was
 copied
 from kmart and and sears they just they
 just lifted that model
 and the reason why sam walton spent all
 this time
 in all the comparative stores is because
 he had no ideas of his own
 he just looked at what other people are
 doing and he
 copied the best of what he could find
 and
 and that's what so if you look at
 walmart i mean
 what is the intellectual property of
 walmart now after 15 20 years they got
 you know a bunch of competitive
 advantage with scale and logistics and
 all of that
 but in the first 10 or 15 years there's
 no advantage
 all they're doing is it's execution it's
 great execution
 on a on a base model if you look at
 costco
 uh everything about costco was copied
 from price
 price club so sold price uh
 so if we talk to jim senegal
 someone asked jim senegal what did you
 learn
 from soul price he said it's
 the wrong question there's nothing i
 know that i didn't learn from sole price
 okay so the whole costco model
 everything about it
 and actually the cloner became better
 than the original
 you know like walmart became better than
 kmart and
 microsoft became better than so many
 other companies so i think that
 yes you can invest in the innovators
 but i think that's much harder to get
 right
 um if if if
 some businesses are consistent cloners
 and they're good at it
 and i don't think markets recognize
 the power of great cloning so if you can
 if you can identify
 you know i think even even at some level
 if you look at something someone like
 starbucks
 you know he looked at what was happening
 in italy and he said i think this will
 play in peoria
 and he took that italian cafe and
 brought it to period the funny thing is
 now
 starbucks is scaling in italy you know
 who would have thought
 that they can scale scale italy but
 they're scaling in italy
 um so i always feel that
 if you can identify a business that is
 good at cloning
 and has kind of
 embraced it the way nbr nvr embraced the
 buybacks
 that's a great mental model and
 advantage to have in your arsenal
 really appreciate it i was curious if
 you could talk a little bit about
 how you document your investing process
 um earlier you mentioned a bit of a
 checklist
 and uh you mentioned a little bit about
 focusing and really honing in on those
 two or three variables that you really
 have to understand
 so maybe just talk about that checklist
 you know do you write things
 down do you do excel models or you know
 what gets put to paper and what's the
 output along the way
 from idea to purchase for for most
 for most of my career i
 functioned alone and now
 now because uh i had another entity and
 i've got uh
 horsepower so i've got two guys who
 uh help me and work with me
 i i have not i think almost never built
 excel models or anything like that
 they they they will do that sometimes
 and
 and such but the precision can be
 uh can lead you astray uh because
 businesses are not
 they're not linear and they don't you
 know grow 15 a year
 every year and so on um so i think
 model in your head where you're able to
 figure out
 uh kind of what um
 uh what is going on and how this
 business works and how it makes money
 and and then you know you go deeper and
 see if
 all the facts uh check out
 the the checklist comes in before the
 investment
 and the main the main benefit the
 checklist has
 is that you know we are we are driven
 by greed so when we when we encounter
 some new shiny new investment ideas we
 can be enamored by it
 and the checklist kind of puts a lot of
 cold water a lot of stuff
 so it asks a bunch of questions that
 the big advantage it has is that many
 times i've not even thought about those
 questions
 so i think i've thought about every side
 of it but when i actually go through the
 individual questions uh like i think our
 checklist has about 160 questions on it
 and
 i'll find that i don't know the answers
 to 10 questions
 and which means that i have more work to
 do
 and so that's the big advantage is like
 it identifies holes
 in the analysis um and then i
 go back and you know do the work to be
 able to
 uh answer those ten questions so that's
 where the the checklist comes in it's
 really just trying to make sure you've
 thought about things uh in a complete
 in a complete manner and also what it
 also
 shows you is there are no businesses
 maybe other than costco that go through
 a checklist with no blemishes
 like everything is fine every business
 has issues uh and
 those issues will get highlighted by the
 checklist
 and the question you gotta decide is
 is this issue going to be the one that
 does them in
 right and so you've got to make a
 judgment call um
 on on that so there are i mean i think
 that
 it's part art part science uh so you you
 can look at the
 areas where the business has
 vulnerabilities
 and issues and then you've got to just
 see hey can i
 does it still make sense
 when i know these are the areas where
 the business may have difficulty
 um does it still make sense hi sir
 thank you thank you for your time i saw
 a speech of you and you mentioned that
 you
 invested in one skill company that is
 unvalued and you made
 over 100 return and just have and one
 year
 i want what to use to find out a company
 that is
 unvalued you read the balance sheet or
 you have other tools
 we made a 4x on that company in a couple
 of years
 there was a company called ipsco uh the
 canadian steel company and there i think
 it was a relatively simple thesis where
 the stock was in the low 40s and they
 had no debt they had about 15
 a share in cash and the next two years
 of
 contracts that they had on their books
 was going to give them
 about 15 a year in in
 earnings and so my take was and and
 it's it's a very high uncertainty
 business with a lot of
 fluctuation in earnings because they
 made uh
 tubular steel which went into pipelines
 so if a big pipeline is being built then
 they have contracts and
 there could be no contracts after a
 couple of years right
 so so the uh the situation was
 you know i'm paying 45 a share and i
 fast forward two years
 i have 45 on the balance sheet and all
 the plants and equipment and
 inventory is free so i said that
 that doesn't make sense the business has
 to have a value over 45 dollars
 because all those things can be
 liquidated for some price
 if you're if you're not a going concern
 and if you're a going concern it has
 even more value than a liquidation
 uh scenario so i said you know what i'm
 going to do is i'm just going to buy
 this company and
 own it for two years and just see what
 the market does
 the price you know because i said let
 the
 30 come in and let's see what the market
 does and
 i think about eight or ten months after
 i bought it
 the company said that they have one more
 year
 of fifteen dollars a share in earnings
 and so i said oh so now we are at sixty
 dollars right because we've got three
 years of fifteen dollars
 and the stock went to by that time it
 had gone to
 seventy eighty dollars a share at that
 time and then uh
 it was inching up to maybe about 90 and
 then
 a swedish company came and offered to
 buy them
 for 160 a share
 in 2006 and
 i didn't even wait for the deal to close
 the stock went to like 150 something
 and five minutes after that i was out of
 there um
 and uh so that that was fine and um
 so if you um if you look at
 uh value investors club um
 and you read you know write-ups there
 that's a good place to uh understand and
 find businesses uh
 if you have a subscription to sum zero
 or you're a member of sum
 zero that's another area where you can
 get
 uh some some of this and then you know
 sometimes there are articles and seeking
 alpha and so on so there's a few
 different places
 and then you know you can look at data
 aroma and then you can try to reverse
 engineer
 why does david pepper own this or why
 does uh
 you know apple known something and so on
 so you can try to reverse engineer
 some of those and take it from there
 um so and you know the different things
 happen like you know
 last year i was i visited a company in
 turkey
 in istanbul and uh
 you know they they they have a few
 different businesses but they have a
 bunch of warehouses
 uh they have like 12 million square feet
 of warehouses
 and uh they're the largest warehouse
 operator in turkey and they're
 they're their tenants are all like ikea
 car for amazon and so on and they've got
 really really blue chip tenants
 and the market cap of the company was
 like
 less than 30 million dollars
 and the liquidation value was somewhere
 between
 maybe three four hundred million to a
 billion dollars
 okay and
 once i had you know kicked the tires
 enough
 to know that all those things were real
 you know and you know
 we spent an afternoon going to all the
 warehouses and so on
 um you know we
 loaded up even better than ipsco
 right if i can buy a
 asset for 30 million that on a bad day
 is worth 300 million
 um you know turkey has a lot of
 challenges
 but uh in many cases micro will trump
 macro
 and at at some price uh your
 your your risk levels go down that that
 business has gone up
 uh about seven eight times in value
 in the last 13 14 months
 in spite of the pandemic and all that so
 anyway so what i'm saying is that uh
 you keep poking around and once in a
 while things hit you in the head like a
 two by four
 and when they hit you in a headband when
 they say what what is that
 like you know when you're like really
 like shocked and surprised
 that's when you act it was like if
 you're just saying ah yeah okay whatever
 just ignore all of those look at the
 ones that totally blow you away
 and then go for those
 shock at all in your book a lot about
 the kelly criterion but you kind of say
 you
 you think you never go for kelly or
 anything like that so how much of a role
 does it play in your capital asset
 allocation decisions is it more of like
 a guideline
 um and do you or you know hard and fast
 like do the math out
 kind of thing and then you know a
 follow-up would be like do you
 apply it to your entire portfolio or
 just your dry powder if i ever do a
 revision to the dhandu investor i will
 take out the kelly
 discussion entirely and in fact i will
 even say that
 it doesn't apply to investing so i don't
 use the kelly and it was a mistake to
 put in the book
 the main issue with the kelly criteria
 is that it works
 really well if we get to make a bunch of
 similar bets like if we do 100 coin
 tosses
 where heads is 51 percent and tails is
 49
 and i keep betting heads you can use
 that formula to figure out
 if you have 100 how much you should put
 on each bet
 so it's good for when you get a
 opportunity to make many bets
 which are very similar in odds uh
 but it doesn't apply like when i talked
 about the company in
 in turkey or the steel company whatever
 else i mean those are
 investing we're making one bet at a time
 and we don't have the
 have the luxury of making a second or
 third bet like that
 so i would just ignore kelly completely
 i know it sounds exciting and everything
 but it's not relevant
 um so how do you manage the balance
 between say diversification and then
 also you talked about about staying
 within your circle of confidence so
 how do you like manage those things
 without like throwing away everything
 you can throw away nearly everything and
 that's fine
 so uh arvind stall heard me talk many
 times about
 charlie's friend john ryega in
 northern california who's a billionaire
 and all he's done in his career
 is invest in real estate within a couple
 of miles of the stanford campus
 so john ariega's circular competence
 is like this small it's really tiny
 it's not even real estate it's not even
 real estate in california it's not even
 real estate in
 northern california it's real estate in
 a very
 narrow geography if you showed him a
 deal in sacramento
 it would take him a femtosecond to say
 i'm not interested
 because he he doesn't want to go there
 so and with being
 with being in a very very narrow circle
 of competence
 it did not prevent him from becoming
 extremely wealthy
 so the good thing about investing is
 that it doesn't matter
 how big your circular competence is uh
 what is really important
 is to not step out of it
 and what is even more important is just
 try to play
 in the epicenter of that circle
 so if you look at a business and you say
 i'm not sure about this or i don't
 understand this
 or whatever be a harsh grader and get
 rid of it
 and you know focus on the most obvious
 stuff and
 some of the most obvious stuff is things
 that we are consumers of
 so if you're using a certain brand or
 you're using some service
 or whatever else you know like uh like
 you know
 i like to bike and uh a lot of the
 biking parts come
 from a company called shimano in japan
 and i know from biking that shimano has
 very strong brand recognition and
 they've got pricing power and all these
 things
 i've never looked at a balance sheet i
 just know this from the way they
 dominate in cycling and then i
 looked at them i also found they
 dominated in fishing
 and that's even in the fishing area
 they've got and they've innovated a lot
 uh in that area so i looked at
 shimano and it didn't look obviously
 cheap
 like i was hoping that no one else would
 understand shimano and it would be a two
 times earnings
 and the rest would be history but it
 wasn't that easy so i said oh you know
 it's like a double digit earnings
 whatever forget about it you know move
 on
 you know if it was really cheap i would
 spend more time on it you know
 so um and i only looked at that because
 i was just familiar with it from cycling
 right
 so it can come at you from different
 places
 you uh you mentioned sergio from uh from
 fiat then obviously howard schultz
 starbucks sam walton um obviously all
 very uh
 you know great leaders um i'm curious
 kind of what you look for
 you know certain traits that you look
 for in a board or a ceo
 management team you know when you're
 making those investments how you kind of
 judge a management team
 and then if there's any specific uh your
 other specific leaders that have really
 stuck out
 in today's market good question so the
 way to
 the way to figure out the quality of the
 leader
 is to not focus on what they're saying
 but to focus on what they've done
 so typically these guys have track
 records
 and you can look back at the track
 record i mean
 you know it would have been hard to
 invest in walmart in 1970 or whatever if
 you were really unless you were
 really familiar with sam but if you're
 investing in 1980 or
 1990 you got quite a quite a track
 record to look at
 um sergio it was very obvious to me in
 2012
 what i was a very unusual and good
 leader and i was very excited that
 we were able to actually and it actually
 as that investment progressed uh
 my my assessment of him kept getting
 better
 you know like i had underestimated how
 good he was he just kept getting better
 and better
 and uh and such and uh
 uh so i think the the the sim one thing
 we have is
 as public market investors which
 venture investors don't have is we do
 have trend marks
 that we can look at and we do have
 relatively long histories
 uh that you can look at and uh so i
 think that
 that is really helpful and that's really
 important
 it's really important to get a mental
 model in your mind
 about the nature of the leader and the
 quality of the leader
 and you know their nuances and you don't
 need to
 you don't need to always get this right
 i mean there's an error rate
 you know when i bought when i bought
 fiat
 i also bought gm and uh
 gm basically we made some money i think
 we made 40 50
 on what we invested after several years
 but eventually i sold it because
 i just saw differences very big
 differences
 so that was a good example because i i
 felt like gm had
 competent leadership
 but it was nothing nothing like sergio
 and then you know if you look at
 uh someone like elon you know i mean
 he's on a different planet
 you know i mean i i i don't know if you
 guys saw
 battery day um you know the the
 when he had the battery day and the
 annual meeting uh recently i mean i
 i if i was a competitor of elon
 any any oem car manufacturer
 i'd be very afraid because
 those guys every other ceo has no
 understanding of
 first principles of physics and
 and and so i think they're gonna have a
 very very hard time
 uh and he's increasing the distance so
 uh
 so we don't know how that works out but
 i would just say that
 um you know uh
 extremely impressive guy and uh and
 kind of strange you know somewhat weird
 you know so
 uh i i'm in the charlie munger boat
 which is saying you know
 don't go long or don't go short elon um
 it's hard to go long elon because just
 so expensive
 uh but i i would not want to short a guy
 who lands two rockets simultaneously
 backwards
 uh i mean i don't know why anyone would
 own a shorter guy like that
 so um so anyway i mean i think that
 uh you study the the history and the
 trademarks
 so monash you've been so generous with
 your time that
 you know thank you so much i guess maybe
 i would
 end with one last question which is you
 know
 on this zoom call there are students who
 are graduating from business school
 from college um just
 that you know the world has shifted
 dramatically
 they may feel for their opportunities
 that
 um are there any thoughts that you have
 or
 that you any advice that you would give
 over the decades to come
 and also the short term you know a
 couple of thoughts
 um so one is that
 in in an advanced civilization
 like the united states um
 the odds that any of you
 will be homeless or you know
 not have enough food to eat or
 you know can't pay your rent or any of
 that is those odds approach zero
 um so basically the bottom line is that
 the society has enough safety nets and
 has
 enough opportunities that
 none of you will ever face those
 circumstances
 so given that reality uh what i would
 what i would focus on if i were you is
 i would focus on the pursuit of passion
 so i would really try to figure out what
 is really exciting for you and what you
 really like to do and you know
 one of the things buffett talks about is
 people will say oh you know
 i'm going to um do banking for three
 years then i'm going to get my mba
 then i'm going to do xyz and then you
 know after
 10 years i'm gonna do my own thing uh
 you don't need to take these
 long circuits paths um
 think about what you want to do and just
 go for it
 you know get there uh
 without making a 20-year plan to get
 there
 and one of the i think one of the
 problems that comes up
 when you when you graduate from elite
 institutions
 so the problem you have when you
 graduate from boston college or
 harvard is the opportunity cost
 so what happens is that the world is
 willing to pay
 quite a bit for your services
 and many times they willing the world is
 willing to pay
 more for your services than you would
 make
 if you pursued your passion
 and and if you pursue your passion you
 are giving up
 a lot of certainty but
 given that i told you that you're not
 going to end up homeless
 and you're not going to end up with no
 food on your table
 i would say that stretch a bit
 and uh and try to uh
 try to try to understand internally what
 uh what you love to do and um
 and then uh and and the the other thing
 is that
 um even if you take the
 the easy path which is some guy's giving
 you a great offer and
 it looks great whatever
 you still have plenty of time
 evenings weekends etc to try to think
 about
 what else might be your passion or
 interest and to try to build
 something like my first business i got
 off the ground part
 time while i was working full time and
 then when it got enough traction i
 resigned
 and i didn't have any money or anything
 i actually
 was on credit cards and so on to try to
 get it up and running
 um so that's what i would say is that
 uh the
 younger you are when you do that uh it's
 easier
 when you don't have kids and do that
 it's easier
 and when you're single and you do that
 it's easier so
 for many of you all of those are true
 and uh
 and so i that's what i would suggest is
 if you really want to go down a certain
 path
 uh i think you should uh
 really think about you know
 we we humans are driven by peers
 and we like to compare ourselves to
 peers and you have a lot of peers
 uh in the in the institutions you're at
 uh and so it can be uh it can be
 difficult
 to do something i i remember that the
 uh the founder of i think it was staples
 um uh went to went to harvard business
 school
 and then after that he uh
 joined some grocer and i think while he
 was in school he was
 working um in a grocery store
 you know kind of doing the shelves and
 whatever else
 you know and he said that some harvard
 professor walked into the store
 saw him doing that and didn't want to
 embarrass him and just kind of
 went the other way and he went
 out and you know reached out to the
 professor and said how are you doing
 whatever
 he was not at all concerned and so um
 so that guy wanted to go into retail
 in spite of all the things i've said
 and he was passionate about it
 and he turned down a lot of other offers
 which were
 probably higher paying and he went into
 that area and eventually
 uh founded stables and went from there
 you know so so you have to be willing to
 uh to get off the beaten path you know
 and
 that's what i would suggest is uh be be
 willing and bold to do that
 what a great note to end on money thank
 you
 so much this is fantastic as always
 thank you arvind it was a
 pleasure thank you thank you
