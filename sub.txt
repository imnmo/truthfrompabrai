you didn't attend Harvard Business School you're not a Goldman Sachs alone you don't have a traditional Wall Street pedigree and yet you're a successful investor can you tell me about the learning process that you took that let you become a successful investor yeah well that's a good question and I would say that you know Buffett says that I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor so I came at investing after many years as an entrepreneur and a CEO running a business and in fact the reason y value investing appeal to me is because when you start a business when you run a business you will spend maybe three to five percent of your time on figuring out the strategy and direction and you know the the approach the business is going to take and then the rest of the time is the heavy lifting of actually making things happen and I always enjoyed the three to five percent of time more than the rest of it the rest of it was fine too but the figuring out part was more interesting when I looked at value investing especially looking at it from the lens that Buffett had looked at it at basically i found that you use the same analytics the same part of your brain as you do as a as an entrepreneur or CEO the only difference is that the three to five percent of time becomes seventy percent of your time and so that was very appealing to me in the sense that i love the fact that i would get to spend more time on the parts of the business that i enjoyed the most and the second is that you get leverage you know so one of the things about the investing business is it it has more leverage than pretty much any industry I mean you are basically leveraging brain cells and you're leveraging brain cells even more than a software developer or anyone else does because you're converting what I would say thoughts into cash and that's always nice so so I I like the leverage I like the fact that you have somebody else run the business do all the heavy lifting and you could figure out just which ones you wanted to partner with the BN and so those are the reasons why it was interesting to me and that's why I came at it from a different direction
