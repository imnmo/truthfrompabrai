00:00:00 [Music]
00:00:20 thank you so much as always for being
00:00:21 here we're incredibly grateful
00:00:24 and uh let's get started if you're ready
00:00:28 well uh irwin it's a pleasure to be here
00:00:31 with you i always look forward to
00:00:34 uh to this this particular session
00:00:37 uh every year and actually uh uh
00:00:41 you know the best way to learn is to
00:00:44 teach
00:00:45 and uh i always come away slightly wiser
00:00:49 at the end not so much
00:00:50 because of what i said but because what
00:00:52 some of the interactions and such so i'm
00:00:54 very grateful and uh so i'll i'll go
00:00:58 through
00:00:58 some prepared remarks i mean they're not
00:01:01 really prepared but
00:01:03 they're uh let's say a monologue and uh
00:01:06 i have a few slides
00:01:08 and uh and then uh then i think we can
00:01:11 open up for
00:01:12 questions which is the fun part for me
00:01:14 and
00:01:15 we can focus on what i talked about or
00:01:18 we can focus on
00:01:19 pretty much anything under the sun maybe
00:01:23 other than
00:01:24 you know specific portfolio positions
00:01:26 and such and
00:01:27 uh and uh we can take it from there is
00:01:30 that good
00:01:31 oh yeah here it is okay all right so uh
00:01:34 in the in the early 2000s uh
00:01:38 this book came out uh by maggie maher
00:01:41 and actually
00:01:41 uh uh buffett had recommended this book
00:01:45 it's a it's a great book to read
00:01:47 and uh basically baggy pointed out
00:01:51 that even though we have these uh
00:01:54 like if you look at the s p over a
00:01:56 hundred year period you know nine odd
00:01:58 percent a year
00:01:59 uh that's not the full truth
00:02:02 uh if you will and uh there's
00:02:06 there's more to that than just that just
00:02:09 that nine percent
00:02:10 and um and so uh this is a chart
00:02:15 of the dow from uh
00:02:18 1896 till now so it's covering about
00:02:22 124 years and
00:02:26 and you can see that there have been
00:02:30 very long periods uh where end to end
00:02:34 the result has been zero for investors
00:02:37 uh
00:02:38 so like for example a famous one is
00:02:41 after after the crash of 29 it took
00:02:45 a good quarter century uh to get back to
00:02:48 the same levels
00:02:50 and uh and more recently uh you know if
00:02:53 you look at the
00:02:54 period from 65 to 82
00:02:58 uh the dow was like i think 870 or 865
00:03:02 or so at that time
00:03:04 in 65 and that's approximately where it
00:03:06 ended
00:03:08 in 81.82 so 17-year period when the
00:03:11 u.s economy grew quite a bit but the dow
00:03:15 was uh
00:03:16 was flat and then 82 to 99
00:03:20 uh which is also probably before the
00:03:22 time of most of the people
00:03:24 uh attending uh
00:03:28 the dow was turbocharged you know it
00:03:30 went from less than a thousand
00:03:32 to more than twelve thousand and then uh
00:03:35 more recently uh you know from 99 to
00:03:37 2011
00:03:39 uh was flat and then since 2011 we've
00:03:42 been on the rise so
00:03:44 um and then you know if i just uh
00:03:47 if i uh i'll show you a few more charts
00:03:51 uh like this but but this particular one
00:03:54 uh has some symmetry so
00:03:58 the symmetry is that we had a 17-year
00:04:01 period
00:04:02 uh you know 65 to 82
00:04:06 where the dow was flat and we had
00:04:07 another exact 17-year period
00:04:10 when the dao uh you know did
00:04:13 incredible things and and the reason we
00:04:17 get these
00:04:18 um these periods and especially i think
00:04:22 17 years is an important number
00:04:25 in general human memory does not
00:04:29 go past 17 years and the reason we see
00:04:33 these
00:04:33 kind of long periods of flat markets and
00:04:37 then
00:04:38 you know similar periods of you know uh
00:04:41 very
00:04:42 uh very euphoric rises in prices if you
00:04:45 will or just rise in prices
00:04:47 uh is usually um
00:04:50 like for example in 1965
00:04:54 stocks were quite overheated um you know
00:04:58 very high p e ratios uh high multiples
00:05:02 and in 81 82 they were
00:05:05 extremely undervalued and one could
00:05:08 argue whether it's undervalued because
00:05:09 at that
00:05:10 time in 81 or so
00:05:13 treasuries were yielding 18 um
00:05:16 and uh and so in the 8182 time frame
00:05:21 you could have bought a lot of blue
00:05:22 chips at single-digit multiples you know
00:05:25 coke and mcdonald's and
00:05:28 you know all kinds of great businesses
00:05:30 were available
00:05:32 very very cheap and then when you got to
00:05:35 99
00:05:36 2000 those same businesses
00:05:40 were priced for perfection
00:05:43 so so for example
00:05:46 in the year 2000 microsoft became
00:05:51 for some time the most valued company on
00:05:53 the planet
00:05:54 cisco was right up there both these
00:05:58 companies were about 600 billion or so
00:06:01 in value
00:06:03 and microsoft i think was making less
00:06:05 than 10 billion
00:06:07 and such it was a pretty i think it was
00:06:10 at a 70
00:06:12 plus uh trailing earnings uh multiple
00:06:16 and uh so so these these charts are very
00:06:20 relevant to me because
00:06:21 um i always have great timing in life
00:06:25 and i started my fund in 1990
00:06:30 1999 and what
00:06:33 a beautiful time to start a fund
00:06:37 uh i actually knew uh pretty soon after
00:06:41 i started
00:06:42 that i was
00:06:45 i was going to be i
00:06:48 assumed at that time that there was uh
00:06:52 poetry and symmetry and
00:06:55 history did not just rhyme but history
00:06:57 repeats itself so i just assumed
00:07:00 that till 2016 um we were going to be
00:07:03 flat
00:07:05 uh i assumed we were going to be flat on
00:07:06 the doubt of 2016 and i assume we won't
00:07:08 be flat on the dow
00:07:11 on the s p till 2016 or so and
00:07:14 the nasdaq i didn't even know when that
00:07:16 would uh come back because that had
00:07:18 crashed and burned
00:07:20 from five thousand down to one thousand
00:07:22 um
00:07:23 uh so i thought that was just done for a
00:07:25 very long time
00:07:26 um and uh and so
00:07:30 uh so i started my my journey as an
00:07:34 investor
00:07:36 in 94. uh that was the first time i
00:07:38 heard about warren buffett
00:07:40 and uh it opened up a whole big world
00:07:43 for me
00:07:44 and 1994 was a one of the
00:07:48 uh you know one of the years of
00:07:52 maximized learning and growth for me i
00:07:55 i was i was it was a completely new area
00:07:58 for me
00:07:59 and i was just like a sponge i was just
00:08:02 you know
00:08:02 uh drinking from a fire hydrant and it
00:08:05 was great
00:08:06 and uh and at that time um
00:08:09 you know uh life was really good because
00:08:14 uh
00:08:15 pretty much anything you did went up you
00:08:18 know
00:08:18 things and i i was a i was running an
00:08:22 i.t business
00:08:23 uh i was uh kind of you know around the
00:08:26 software business and so on
00:08:29 and so i had uh
00:08:32 some some of the investments uh were
00:08:35 tech investments
00:08:36 uh at that time and uh in that period
00:08:40 uh and i was only running my personal
00:08:42 money at that time there was no fund
00:08:44 and in that period um i
00:08:48 uh captured uh two
00:08:51 more than 100 baggers
00:08:54 unfortunately
00:08:58 there wasn't much of a net worth and
00:09:01 so for example one one business i
00:09:04 uh business in india i did i put about
00:09:06 10 or 12 000
00:09:09 and i cashed out about 1.5 million and
00:09:12 of course i should not
00:09:13 uh you know have any regrets about that
00:09:16 that's pretty good
00:09:17 um and and then there was another
00:09:20 business
00:09:20 here in the u.s so the india business
00:09:23 was satyam
00:09:24 satyam computers and the one the u.s
00:09:27 which was a way to you know
00:09:31 kind of ride the internet wave and so on
00:09:33 upside the downside
00:09:35 a company called cmgi actually which was
00:09:39 i actually visited them in massachusetts
00:09:41 around that period
00:09:42 um and that was uh that was about a
00:09:45 hundred bagger
00:09:46 which i captured and there i actually
00:09:48 put in more money i put in about a
00:09:50 hundred thousand
00:09:51 and uh so that is also pretty good there
00:09:53 about 10 million
00:09:54 so uh but but then when i was starting
00:09:57 the funds in
00:09:58 uh 99 and 2000 and so on
00:10:02 i knew i was gonna be facing these huge
00:10:04 headwinds
00:10:05 and uh and i knew that uh
00:10:09 that pretty much anything you looked at
00:10:12 uh didn't look uh i mean the
00:10:16 uh i think all the all the popular stuff
00:10:19 was
00:10:19 was euphoric but actually the day the
00:10:22 nasdaq peaked in march 2000
00:10:25 march 9th or something 2000 was the day
00:10:28 that berkshire hit a
00:10:30 multi-year low uh so basically what was
00:10:33 happening is that
00:10:34 money was going from berkshire hathaway
00:10:36 into pets.com
00:10:37 you know there was a transfer going on
00:10:39 so a lot of stuff
00:10:40 actually which was very basic stuff was
00:10:43 undervalued in
00:10:44 99 2000 but if you were trying to play
00:10:48 any kind of momentum game or you know
00:10:51 flavor of the day or any of that stuff
00:10:53 you very quickly got your head handed to
00:10:55 you um
00:10:57 and because then then the nasdaq went
00:11:00 from like five thousand to one thousand
00:11:01 next couple of years
00:11:03 uh two three years uh so i i knew that
00:11:06 the
00:11:06 uh so the modus operandi i i
00:11:11 um took on when i started my fund was
00:11:14 i really didn't care about the market
00:11:15 much i knew the market was going to give
00:11:17 me a headwind
00:11:18 but i said how does it matter what these
00:11:20 market levels and all that are
00:11:22 or whether it's euphoric or not if all i
00:11:25 do is i focus on buying a dollar for 50
00:11:28 cents
00:11:29 and when that dollar gets to 90 cents or
00:11:32 more i sell it
00:11:33 and uh and so that became the
00:11:37 the cornerstone of how i invested is i
00:11:40 looked for
00:11:42 dollar bills that were uh trading for 50
00:11:44 cents or less
00:11:46 and then as they get tonight got to 90
00:11:48 cents or more
00:11:49 i was uh unloading them which was
00:11:51 different from the previous
00:11:53 five years where like for example the
00:11:55 company i bought in india
00:11:57 i just took those shares and i actually
00:12:00 got physical chairs
00:12:01 stuck them in a drawer and my mental
00:12:03 model was to never open that drawer
00:12:05 i wasn't even concerned with you know
00:12:07 what the multiple i knew that they had
00:12:09 so much tailwinds in terms of growth uh
00:12:12 that i didn't want to really mess with
00:12:14 any calculations i just said
00:12:16 you know set it and forget it kind of
00:12:17 thing and the same thing
00:12:19 uh with cmgi i could not tell kind of
00:12:22 what the
00:12:23 upper limits of cmgi were it was kind of
00:12:26 very nebulous
00:12:28 but i was buying at a pretty floor price
00:12:31 uh because cmj i was spawning.coms
00:12:34 so you know harmony.com they're going to
00:12:36 spawn i have no idea
00:12:38 uh what valuations are the ones those
00:12:40 gonna have no idea
00:12:41 but it all looks like wild and crazy so
00:12:45 we'll just keep the mother ship that
00:12:46 keeps producing these eggs
00:12:48 and uh see where it goes and and you
00:12:50 know eventually it got to a ridiculous
00:12:51 valuation
00:12:53 thankfully i was smart enough to sell
00:12:55 and move on
00:12:56 uh but in in the in the last 20 years
00:13:01 or 21 years i took this
00:13:04 buy it 50 or less or less and sell it 90
00:13:08 or more
00:13:09 and uh that that
00:13:12 that actually works quite well
00:13:15 in this environment from 1999 to 2011.
00:13:20 it it so what i'm what i'm trying to say
00:13:23 is that
00:13:24 if i look at my 25 year or 26 year
00:13:27 journey
00:13:29 i was using two different models
00:13:33 for two different periods okay and
00:13:37 and one of the things i forgot you know
00:13:39 because it had been so long that i've
00:13:41 been doing the
00:13:43 buying at 50 and 70
00:13:46 that it completely left my mind
00:13:50 that i'm supposed to at some point
00:13:52 switch back
00:13:54 okay and and i never really i just
00:13:57 thought this buyer 50 seller 90 is kind
00:13:59 of the way
00:14:00 i go through permanently and uh let me
00:14:03 just go through some of these slides and
00:14:05 then i'll continue
00:14:07 uh with kind of because uh the year 20
00:14:09 2020
00:14:11 you know most humans want to go from the
00:14:14 year 2019 straight to 2021.
00:14:17 they want to purge 2020
00:14:21 that they want to behave like 2020 never
00:14:24 happened
00:14:25 you know that's how they would like to
00:14:26 go through life um
00:14:28 in my case 2020
00:14:31 i would say has been probably the second
00:14:34 highest uh year of learning
00:14:38 after 94. uh and so
00:14:41 i've had incredible learning and growth
00:14:44 this year
00:14:46 i'm very grateful for the learning and
00:14:48 growth who knows if the pandemic had
00:14:50 anything to do with it maybe
00:14:52 it did because i got so much time to
00:14:54 stare at my navel
00:14:56 and uh you know when i contemplate my
00:14:58 naval good things happen
00:15:00 so i had a lot of contemplation of the
00:15:01 naval this year
00:15:03 um and anyway so this is the dao
00:15:06 and you look at the s p and uh
00:15:10 you know it's uh it's somewhat similar
00:15:13 it didn't have the exact 1717 but you
00:15:16 know recently
00:15:17 until 2013 it was completely flat
00:15:20 and uh and then you look at the nasdaq
00:15:24 and uh what a beautiful chart
00:15:27 uh so you look at the nasdaq and from
00:15:31 1980 to 2000
00:15:33 you know 20 a year
00:15:36 awesome great and and then
00:15:40 of course you can see the head handed to
00:15:41 you uh
00:15:43 from 2000 till 2003 or something when it
00:15:45 you know gets close to a thousand
00:15:47 and then it takes uh 16 years
00:15:50 to get back to the 5000 level and then
00:15:53 more recently
00:15:54 it's you know been doing that 21 or so
00:15:58 uh so the nasdaq is kind of interesting
00:16:00 because it's actually uh
00:16:03 gone through this uh and and actually if
00:16:06 you think about the nasdaq yes from 1980
00:16:08 to 2000
00:16:10 there was incredible technological
00:16:12 innovations
00:16:13 in tech and software and and hardware
00:16:17 and so on but so was the case
00:16:20 from 2000 to 2016. i mean even till now
00:16:23 i mean the you know there's been uh
00:16:26 incredible
00:16:27 uh changes but what happened is that the
00:16:29 valuations in 2000
00:16:31 was so high that
00:16:35 all the all the growth and
00:16:38 growth and uh you know growth and
00:16:40 profits and all of that
00:16:41 were not enough uh to
00:16:44 uh get the index back to where it was so
00:16:47 for example a good example is microsoft
00:16:52 i remember in 2000
00:16:56 i just started the fund there was a guy
00:16:59 who was
00:17:01 one of the early early employees at
00:17:04 microsoft pretty high up and
00:17:06 he'd retired and he said you know he
00:17:08 joined my friend he said monitoring if
00:17:10 you're ever in seattle
00:17:12 i could introduce you to some of my
00:17:16 former colleagues and and some people
00:17:18 have left and
00:17:19 they may have an interest in your fund
00:17:21 and so on uh
00:17:22 so i told him hey you know i'm gonna be
00:17:24 in seattle day after tomorrow
00:17:26 you know what a coincidence and uh
00:17:29 so he said oh that's great so uh we
00:17:32 spent a day
00:17:33 where he took me to microsoft
00:17:35 headquarters
00:17:37 and i went from one office to the other
00:17:38 and he was trying to
00:17:40 he was a great sales guy for me trying
00:17:42 to convince these guys to
00:17:44 give me money and i i got a lot of
00:17:45 commitments uh and
00:17:47 a lot of investors uh from microsoft uh
00:17:51 or for all former microsoft people
00:17:53 some current some former it was great
00:17:55 but i told them all at that time
00:17:57 when we were just talking that uh i said
00:18:00 look
00:18:01 you guys have in many cases 90
00:18:04 of your net worth in microsoft stock and
00:18:07 options
00:18:08 and your livelihood comes from the same
00:18:11 place
00:18:12 and i said i hate to burst your bubble
00:18:16 but this
00:18:16 is not going to end well um
00:18:20 and and they all told me oh you don't
00:18:22 understand our business
00:18:24 uh the companies never it you know the
00:18:27 stock just goes up like clockwork
00:18:29 and we get our options and we hang on to
00:18:31 them and life is great
00:18:33 and uh i told them that was not going to
00:18:36 be the case
00:18:37 uh but none of them actually even wanted
00:18:39 to hear the math about
00:18:41 the 70 times trading earnings whatever
00:18:43 else and
00:18:44 until 2015 or 16
00:18:48 microsoft was zero returns uh and
00:18:52 it wasn't just zero returns uh it was a
00:18:56 very violent ride uh with a with a huge
00:18:59 drop in the next two or three years
00:19:01 and then another huge drop during the
00:19:03 financial crisis it was
00:19:05 uh it had been very very hard to hold
00:19:07 the stock
00:19:08 uh over that period and of course
00:19:10 finally
00:19:11 uh they've kind of uh digested that and
00:19:14 now we're
00:19:15 back on the upswing and then then we get
00:19:18 to the nikkei
00:19:20 um which peaked in 1990
00:19:24 and has not yet
00:19:27 come back and so it's been
00:19:31 30 or 31 years of uh
00:19:34 minus two percent a year and uh
00:19:38 so uh
00:19:41 the more fun the party
00:19:45 the more extreme the hangover and
00:19:48 this was a very fun party uh this was a
00:19:51 party like no other
00:19:53 uh so at that time i think in 1990
00:19:57 uh you know and this was anecdotal
00:19:59 evidence i looked it up the
00:20:01 um they said the imperial palace in
00:20:04 tokyo
00:20:05 uh was valued more than all the real
00:20:07 estate
00:20:08 i mean the entire state of california in
00:20:10 terms of real estate
00:20:11 and i actually found that statistic
00:20:14 pretty hard to believe so i actually
00:20:15 researched it
00:20:16 and it was absolutely true actually if
00:20:18 you looked at the
00:20:20 the transaction prices of uh
00:20:23 the properties right around the uh
00:20:25 around the imperial palace
00:20:27 and then you extrapolated to the you
00:20:29 know square footage
00:20:30 and acreage of the imperial palace you
00:20:33 would get to
00:20:34 a valuation that would exceed state of
00:20:36 california
00:20:38 and uh and of course that's a ridiculous
00:20:41 valuation
00:20:42 uh we have beautiful coastline for
00:20:44 thousands of miles
00:20:46 here in california and uh and there's
00:20:48 some very very
00:20:49 very very um uh valuable real estate
00:20:53 and so um so that bubble popped
00:20:56 and uh we haven't come back yet and uh
00:20:59 we'll have to see when we come back
00:21:04 and then you know you look at the korean
00:21:06 cosby and this is another one where
00:21:09 you know if you if you ignore that 2009
00:21:11 to
00:21:12 2011 period it's pretty similar to japan
00:21:15 you know it's basically been about 30
00:21:17 plus years
00:21:18 of pretty much nothing you know and
00:21:21 especially
00:21:22 uh the last few years uh and
00:21:26 korea i mean if you look at korea in 89
00:21:30 i mean the korean economy as we know it
00:21:32 doesn't exist at that time
00:21:34 uh i mean it's it's an incredible
00:21:36 miracle growth economy
00:21:38 uh i mean japan was already an advanced
00:21:42 uh advanced civilization korea was yet
00:21:45 to
00:21:46 have its run and in spite of all that
00:21:48 run the
00:21:49 the cosby hasn't moved and actually
00:21:52 korea has a
00:21:53 quite a cheap market it's a it's a place
00:21:56 i'm actually
00:21:57 interested and excited to invest in
00:22:01 so anyway so that's the
00:22:05 those are the slides i wanted to share
00:22:08 and
00:22:10 and uh so if we uh
00:22:13 if we if we look at all of this so
00:22:17 in the year in the year 2000 and i told
00:22:19 you that
00:22:20 i had this this really
00:22:25 terrific growth and learning
00:22:28 and and you know when i tell you about
00:22:31 what i learned
00:22:34 you're gonna say what a dummy you know
00:22:38 like it took him 26 years to learn this
00:22:41 stupid stuff
00:22:42 and uh yeah well you know some of us are
00:22:44 dense and uh
00:22:46 it takes uh it takes some time to uh
00:22:50 learn these lessons so uh
00:22:55 you know charlie munger says we are
00:22:58 old too soon and why is too late
00:23:03 and um but i still feel it's not too
00:23:06 late you know i mean i'm 56
00:23:08 hopefully there is uh a good three
00:23:11 decades
00:23:12 of compounding ahead so that's that's uh
00:23:15 if i can get uh
00:23:16 two and a half or three decades of
00:23:18 compounding life is great
00:23:20 um so one of the things that monger has
00:23:23 mentioned is he said that there's no
00:23:27 intellectual way a intellectual way to
00:23:31 defend it but
00:23:34 he does not sell businesses he owns
00:23:39 when they get above intrinsic value
00:23:42 and he won't buy them above intrinsic
00:23:45 value
00:23:47 but he won't sell them if they are you
00:23:50 know somewhat
00:23:50 above intrinsic value or even even
00:23:52 reasonably above intrinsic value
00:23:55 um i think i think uh if it gets too
00:23:58 egregious egregiously above intrinsic
00:24:01 value i think he would look at it but
00:24:03 the berkshire history is that even uh
00:24:06 even when they looked at for example if
00:24:08 you look at coke for example
00:24:10 which in the year 2000 was at you know
00:24:13 40 plus times earnings
00:24:15 and it didn't do anything for a long
00:24:16 time because it was
00:24:18 quite overvalued uh they haven't touched
00:24:21 their core position in 32 years
00:24:23 and my guess would be they wouldn't
00:24:24 should they won't touch it for
00:24:26 another few decades um so
00:24:30 so it'll go on for a while so the one uh
00:24:34 so when munger says that he's willing to
00:24:36 hold
00:24:37 uh whole businesses above intrinsic
00:24:39 value
00:24:41 uh that kind of goes against what i'm
00:24:43 trying to do with the
00:24:44 you know 50 cents to 90 cents right
00:24:48 because the two
00:24:48 are different uh frameworks
00:24:52 and but when i
00:24:56 when i studied that some more i realized
00:25:00 that the the key
00:25:03 and this is especially true i believe in
00:25:06 the
00:25:07 in this period which is i mean so if we
00:25:09 look at this period
00:25:12 you know i wish i had made this change
00:25:14 ideally if i made this change in
00:25:16 thinking
00:25:17 about two or three years ago that would
00:25:20 have been actually i would have hit the
00:25:20 nail on the head perfectly
00:25:22 if i had made this because by till 2016
00:25:25 or so
00:25:27 the markets really were you know they
00:25:29 hadn't
00:25:30 done a whole lot and actually the the
00:25:32 previous approach
00:25:34 uh worked really well uh in terms of
00:25:36 returns and so on
00:25:38 so i was kind of i think i'm probably
00:25:40 two or two years or so
00:25:42 behind but in a in a 26 year
00:25:46 history uh we can we can be forgiven
00:25:49 for being a couple of years behind on
00:25:51 something so that's okay
00:25:53 so um
00:25:58 so a few things uh kind of uh
00:26:01 came together for me this year some of
00:26:04 you may have looked at a company called
00:26:06 nvr and nvr is a home builder
00:26:10 i think in virginia um mid-atlantic and
00:26:14 so on
00:26:15 and uh they they have had
00:26:18 religion related to buybacks
00:26:22 which has been very intense so from 1994
00:26:26 till now other than for a couple of
00:26:29 years in 2008 or 2009 when their
00:26:31 business was
00:26:32 upside down they pretty much brought
00:26:34 back their stock every year
00:26:36 and and over this period they have spent
00:26:40 at least 100 percent of owner earnings
00:26:44 on buybacks and probably over 100
00:26:47 you know they were they were actually
00:26:48 even willing to spend uh beyond their
00:26:51 own earnings on buybacks
00:26:53 and the nvr business itself if i look at
00:26:56 it from 2000
00:26:57 like in the last 20 years you know the
00:27:00 the top line's gone up
00:27:01 maybe three four times it hasn't it's
00:27:05 it's not a company that has any
00:27:06 intellectual property it's a home
00:27:08 builder
00:27:09 um so the top line has gone up three
00:27:11 four times
00:27:13 they bought back in the last 20 years 56
00:27:16 of their shares outstanding over the
00:27:18 last 26 years i haven't looked at it
00:27:21 exactly but it's over 80
00:27:23 it may be approaching 90 of the shares
00:27:25 outstanding have been
00:27:26 bought back but in the last 20 years the
00:27:29 56
00:27:30 reduction in share count uh the stock
00:27:34 is up 55 times so
00:27:38 the company delivered a 55 x return
00:27:42 in the last 20 years against the
00:27:45 headwind
00:27:46 of over overheated index
00:27:51 and you know that didn't even matter for
00:27:53 a company like nvr
00:27:55 and uh so i looked at nvr and then you
00:27:57 know
00:27:58 uh i have a i have a
00:28:02 friend nick sleep uh who's
00:28:05 who's in the uk and you know nick
00:28:08 nick had most of his money uh i believe
00:28:12 when he was running his fund in three
00:28:13 stocks you know it was
00:28:15 amazon costco and berkshire and
00:28:18 uh i think it was in 2015 or so he hung
00:28:21 up his boots and returned all the
00:28:23 capital he was running i think he
00:28:25 returned probably three billion dollars
00:28:26 or so
00:28:27 to his investors and basically told them
00:28:29 that
00:28:30 in effect i have three stocks uh ten
00:28:33 years from now i'm going to have these
00:28:34 three stocks
00:28:35 uh there's no need for you to pay me
00:28:37 ridiculous fees just go buy these three
00:28:39 stocks
00:28:40 um and of course is institutional
00:28:43 investors freaked out when they got the
00:28:45 money back
00:28:46 i got some calls asking hey we gotta
00:28:48 mark this money back
00:28:49 what should we do i said he told you
00:28:52 what to do
00:28:53 you know and then they'd say oh our
00:28:55 mandate doesn't allow us to buy stocks
00:28:58 so then i said would you like me to set
00:28:59 up a vehicle
00:29:01 where i buy those three stocks for you
00:29:02 and then you can pay me a carry
00:29:05 you know so uh i mean the life life is
00:29:08 kind of funny that way
00:29:09 um but uh but anyway so if you look at
00:29:13 if you look at nick nick also like like
00:29:16 charlie
00:29:17 you know once he finds these great
00:29:21 compounders um and he's got
00:29:24 a number of models he's using he's
00:29:28 he he's looking to let them run and
00:29:31 looking to let them run for decades
00:29:33 and and actually in in next portfolio
00:29:37 it didn't even matter what he owned
00:29:42 as long as he owned amazon
00:29:45 so what i'm saying is that the the
00:29:48 error rate he didn't have much of a
00:29:52 error rate but even if you're wrong on
00:29:54 a few of these but you end up with a few
00:29:58 compounders in the mix
00:30:00 over a long period of time or a die-hard
00:30:04 cannibal which has a very stable
00:30:05 business
00:30:07 the the results are very non-linear
00:30:12 so i operated in a very linear
00:30:16 fashion for the last two decades and
00:30:19 what i learned
00:30:20 this year is two or three things
00:30:24 one as i said one one thing i learned is
00:30:26 hey monish
00:30:27 uh we're back to that curve going up
00:30:30 the flat curve period is over okay
00:30:33 and and the second is that you can look
00:30:37 at
00:30:37 the berkshire examples or the next leaf
00:30:39 examples a number of other examples you
00:30:41 can look at
00:30:42 chuck acree you can look at number of uh
00:30:46 investors and you'll see that if they've
00:30:48 held these compounders for long periods
00:30:51 of time
00:30:53 uh uh the the results are really good i
00:30:56 mean it it works out well
00:30:58 it does it it would not have worked out
00:31:01 well
00:31:02 from 2000 to 2015 2016 i think what i
00:31:05 was doing
00:31:07 worked a lot better in that period
00:31:10 because
00:31:10 if you're buying these compounders at 50
00:31:13 times earnings
00:31:14 uh not very many good things are going
00:31:17 to happen to
00:31:18 you probably um so so so
00:31:21 valuation and price matters and it was
00:31:23 hard to find
00:31:25 a lot of compounders in 2000. you know
00:31:27 you could have bought berkshire for
00:31:29 example
00:31:29 you'd run fairly well for a few for for
00:31:32 at least 10 years
00:31:34 uh but but but for the most part uh
00:31:37 it was what worked in that period was
00:31:39 this buy and sell buy and sell
00:31:41 which is tax inefficient uh but um
00:31:46 but it it definitely was better than
00:31:48 holding microsoft
00:31:49 uh from 2000 2016 for example but
00:31:53 so so the period we're in right now
00:31:55 right so
00:32:00 i'm assuming even though i don't use
00:32:02 macro
00:32:03 or anything but what i'm assuming will
00:32:06 end up happening is what has happened in
00:32:08 the past
00:32:09 and what what what with this party
00:32:13 this party that's underway right now
00:32:17 will end when we get to extreme euphoria
00:32:22 and at some point we will get to extreme
00:32:24 euphoria
00:32:26 so i don't know if that extreme euphoria
00:32:29 comes in 2025 or 2030
00:32:33 uh but let's say somewhere between my
00:32:36 guess is somewhere between
00:32:38 the late 2020s and maybe the early 2030s
00:32:42 is my best guess is when we would get to
00:32:46 ridiculous valuations again because the
00:32:48 human memory doesn't go
00:32:50 back that far and people always say oh
00:32:53 these companies are different
00:32:55 they don't have anything to the
00:32:56 companies in the past so there's no real
00:32:58 correlation
00:33:00 but there are correlations so as long as
00:33:02 humans are
00:33:03 involved in markets we will go from
00:33:05 extreme under
00:33:07 undervaluation to extreme overvaluation
00:33:11 so if you look at the period
00:33:13 from 82 to 99
00:33:17 extreme undervaluation to extreme
00:33:20 overvaluation
00:33:21 and then 99 to again 2015 2016
00:33:26 extreme overvaluation to undervalued and
00:33:29 then you again
00:33:30 start going so we we will we will not
00:33:34 have i don't believe we will have
00:33:37 these boom and bust periods
00:33:40 go away i don't know whether they'll be
00:33:44 you know 17 years long or 30 years long
00:33:47 or 10 years long we've seen a few
00:33:51 examples where they go on for different
00:33:53 periods
00:33:54 um i mean if you get to extreme binges
00:33:57 uh you will go for longer periods uh in
00:33:59 general i think that's true
00:34:01 uh so i think for me the
00:34:04 the learnings have been that
00:34:08 um
00:34:12 is focus on the compounders um
00:34:17 the wiring of monish doesn't allow him
00:34:20 to pay up i'm too cheap to pay up
00:34:24 right so so i'm i'm stuck in a world
00:34:29 where i have to buy things fairly cheap
00:34:34 but but there are you know there's 50
00:34:38 000 stocks in the world
00:34:40 there are stocks from time to time which
00:34:42 are great compounders or great cannibals
00:34:45 and which do get cheap uh
00:34:49 periodically so we don't need too many
00:34:51 of them i mean for the most part
00:34:53 great compounders are well recognized by
00:34:56 the world
00:34:57 and they typically trade at premium
00:35:00 valuations like they should
00:35:02 but that's not always the case and so if
00:35:05 if we can find two or three things
00:35:08 uh or even even one idea a year which is
00:35:12 a great compounder or a great cannibal
00:35:15 or both
00:35:16 and uh and you know we can get it at a
00:35:18 reasonable price and then
00:35:20 you know set it and forget it um
00:35:23 it's great and so when i look at my
00:35:26 portfolio today
00:35:28 it it needs some work to get
00:35:31 positioned where it needs to be but it's
00:35:34 on its way i'm actually very happy with
00:35:36 the way it looks i would i will make a
00:35:38 few more changes over the next few years
00:35:40 to get it more
00:35:41 aligned to where i wanted to be as as
00:35:44 these ideas show up
00:35:45 but the framework is is very simple
00:35:48 that i'm not looking for a 50 cent
00:35:52 dollar bill
00:35:53 uh that's not what i'm looking for
00:35:55 anymore uh what i'm looking for
00:35:58 is very long runways at very reasonable
00:36:01 prices
00:36:02 with a lot of stability so uh with that
00:36:06 i think we can
00:36:08 open up for questions comments on this
00:36:11 subject or whatever else you'd like to
00:36:12 talk about
00:36:15 hi sir i want to ask a question um can
00:36:17 you talk about one
00:36:18 example of the failure of your
00:36:20 investment experience that give you the
00:36:22 most
00:36:23 divisive impression i mean the figure in
00:36:26 your
00:36:26 investment experience there are
00:36:30 a lot of failures and there's a lot of
00:36:33 investing mistakes i think that's just
00:36:35 par for the course
00:36:36 uh you're not going to be able to go
00:36:37 through an investing career without
00:36:40 a number of things that don't work out i
00:36:42 mean in general
00:36:44 uh what we're trying to do is we're
00:36:46 trying to extrapolate deep into the
00:36:48 future
00:36:49 and businesses are kind of living
00:36:51 breathing things and
00:36:53 they've you know capitalism is brutal
00:36:57 so there's a lot of competitive forces
00:36:59 acting on a lot of businesses
00:37:00 so there's a number of reasons why uh
00:37:04 things may not work out so if i go back
00:37:07 and look at
00:37:08 the the failures or the
00:37:11 businesses that i've invested in that
00:37:12 did not work out
00:37:14 um probably the number one reason why
00:37:18 a number of investments didn't work out
00:37:19 was leverage
00:37:21 so i i had a few zeros
00:37:25 and a few near zeros uh because
00:37:29 businesses were uh
00:37:32 over leveraged and they couldn't handle
00:37:35 the leverage they had
00:37:37 so so uh
00:37:40 i've had a difficult time in financials
00:37:43 for example
00:37:45 so in the financial crisis
00:37:48 in 2008 09 there was a company i owned
00:37:51 called delta financial
00:37:53 which was a mortgage lender
00:37:57 uh went bankrupt went to xero
00:38:00 i used to own another company called
00:38:02 compucredit uh
00:38:04 that didn't go to zero but we had a
00:38:06 significant loss there
00:38:09 so i would say that
00:38:12 probably the area that stands out and
00:38:14 it's not just me
00:38:16 when i built my checklist and i looked
00:38:18 at you know
00:38:19 what were the business businesses that
00:38:22 great investors invested in and
00:38:25 where they didn't work out well uh the
00:38:28 number one reason
00:38:31 for the investment not working out was
00:38:34 leverage
00:38:35 and uh so um
00:38:39 i've become a lot more cautious uh
00:38:43 but i'm still not there in the sense
00:38:45 that
00:38:47 i think there are businesses in my
00:38:48 portfolio which uh which have leverage
00:38:51 and i wish they had less of it
00:38:52 but that's definitely a lesson that has
00:38:57 has been well received question
00:39:00 um so i'm just wondering when you're
00:39:03 when you're valuing
00:39:04 valuing a company what are the most
00:39:06 important criteria or metrics you use
00:39:08 in determining its intrinsic value
00:39:12 it bends um
00:39:15 it depends on the business uh so it's
00:39:17 you know i think different industries
00:39:19 and different companies
00:39:21 uh you you have to use uh
00:39:24 different different yardsticks so
00:39:28 like for example you know
00:39:31 i used to own a company in china
00:39:35 uh called maotai which makes a
00:39:39 premium liquor and um
00:39:43 it's a business i should have held on to
00:39:46 but in my infinite wisdom i sold
00:39:48 because of the 50 90 uh and such but uh
00:39:52 i think mao tai went up over a
00:39:56 four or five year period about six seven
00:39:59 times
00:40:00 um and uh you know that's a business
00:40:03 where
00:40:05 the cost of the product is i mean the
00:40:07 bottle a bottle of
00:40:10 the amount i buy you is maybe their cost
00:40:12 is
00:40:13 three four dollars and it goes for like
00:40:16 150 dollars
00:40:19 you know anytime you have a business
00:40:22 like that you're going to do really well
00:40:24 and the 150 dollars in a few years can
00:40:26 be 300
00:40:27 um because they've they've got this
00:40:29 incredible brand and
00:40:31 um you know there's
00:40:34 a massive growth of china backdrop and
00:40:38 it's a it's a status symbol to be able
00:40:41 to serve maokai and so on
00:40:43 so so when you're val when you're
00:40:45 looking at a business like that
00:40:47 uh it's going to be quite a different
00:40:50 analysis than for example when i looked
00:40:53 at uh
00:40:54 another business we owned i think in
00:40:56 2012 we bought fiat chrysler
00:40:59 uh and so there uh the calculus was
00:41:04 very different you know so there we had
00:41:06 a
00:41:07 uh star manager uh you know the business
00:41:10 that was doing 130 plus billion in
00:41:12 revenue
00:41:14 and a five six billion dollar market cap
00:41:16 and uh
00:41:17 you know pretty much um
00:41:21 if they were able to just even slightly
00:41:23 right the ship
00:41:24 uh and even you know
00:41:27 eek out two three percent four percent
00:41:30 in profits
00:41:31 that stock was going to be a
00:41:32 multi-bagger multibagger
00:41:34 so you know the it just depends each
00:41:36 each business and each industry
00:41:39 um i think you have to just and and the
00:41:42 key is that you have to get to
00:41:44 you have to get to the factors that
00:41:46 matter
00:41:50 you know like i would say that if you
00:41:53 look at a
00:41:53 if you look at a company like nvr and
00:41:57 every year they are
00:42:00 taking 100 of owner earnings and putting
00:42:03 it into buybacks
00:42:05 um and you you continue to own the stock
00:42:09 those earnings are not coming to you
00:42:12 okay
00:42:13 you're you're you're owning a bigger and
00:42:16 bigger portion of the pie
00:42:18 but you're not seeing any cash come to
00:42:20 you right
00:42:21 and so in that case the the
00:42:25 the thing that matters uh all that
00:42:28 matters when you own a business like
00:42:30 that
00:42:31 is that whatever endpoint you want to
00:42:34 look at
00:42:36 the question is what are the shares
00:42:39 outstanding
00:42:40 at that end point and what are the what
00:42:44 is the stability and cash flow of the
00:42:45 business at that point
00:42:47 uh because that's how the market would
00:42:49 value it right so so
00:42:51 um so it's a different
00:42:54 it's a very different catalyst for multi
00:42:57 it's a very
00:42:58 different calculus from fiat chrysler so
00:43:01 each business that you're looking at i
00:43:03 think you you need to look at
00:43:05 so the first question even when you get
00:43:07 before you get to all those things is
00:43:09 is um do i understand the business
00:43:13 is it within my circle of competence can
00:43:15 i figure out the two or three variables
00:43:18 that really matter so for example one of
00:43:20 the things about the
00:43:21 nvr home building business is
00:43:25 they don't start building a home
00:43:28 till there's already a person who's
00:43:32 bought it
00:43:34 okay so they don't build any speculative
00:43:36 homes so
00:43:37 i go to them and say i look at the model
00:43:39 and say yeah that's great
00:43:41 i'll buy the home we sign a contract
00:43:43 they see i have a bank loan
00:43:45 and that's when they start building the
00:43:47 that home
00:43:48 so which means that they're
00:43:51 they do not put any capital in
00:43:55 till there's a confirmed sale right and
00:43:58 the second thing about nvr is nvr does
00:44:00 not
00:44:00 own land which is the biggest investment
00:44:04 for a lot of builders they have options
00:44:05 on land
00:44:06 so they typically basically believe in
00:44:08 just in time
00:44:10 manufacturing where they're saying all
00:44:12 the factors of production that i need
00:44:15 to build this home i want to be
00:44:19 bringing those together as close to the
00:44:21 sale point
00:44:22 as possible so when you when you look at
00:44:25 a business like that what that means is
00:44:27 that if the business ebbs and flows
00:44:31 which is the
00:44:32 number of homes they build goes up and
00:44:34 down with the economy
00:44:36 and so on it doesn't really matter
00:44:39 as long as their core overheads are low
00:44:43 okay so let's say for example
00:44:46 their you know their corporate overhead
00:44:49 whatever if they built
00:44:50 zero homes in a year is 25 million
00:44:53 dollars for example
00:44:55 right um so if they didn't build any
00:44:58 homes they would lose 25 million
00:45:00 for example and if you can see that the
00:45:03 balance sheet can handle that for
00:45:04 several years
00:45:06 uh then you're fine then you know that
00:45:08 and you know that if they build
00:45:10 more than a thousand homes
00:45:14 they'll make money more than 500 homes
00:45:16 they'll make money you know you figure
00:45:18 out the metric
00:45:19 at what point they break even and maybe
00:45:21 they're building
00:45:22 5000 homes a year and
00:45:26 you know the number of homes they build
00:45:28 typically
00:45:31 uh fluctuates between five thousand i'm
00:45:32 just pulling these numbers out and i'm
00:45:33 not i'm not
00:45:34 uh nvr is a train according to me that
00:45:38 left that
00:45:38 left the station uh but who knows maybe
00:45:41 in the next 20 years they'll prove me
00:45:42 wrong
00:45:43 where they'll buy back another nine
00:45:44 percent of their talk and be one percent
00:45:46 shares outstanding um so
00:45:49 uh anyway what i'm trying to say is that
00:45:51 each business
00:45:53 uh is completely different and so the
00:45:56 key is can you understand the two or
00:46:00 three variables
00:46:01 that are going to drive the outcome and
00:46:04 it's very important that you've honed in
00:46:06 on those
00:46:06 key variables then usually
00:46:09 the entrepreneur or the ceo running the
00:46:12 businesses
00:46:13 needs to be honed in on the same
00:46:14 variables so if
00:46:16 you have gotten to the point where you
00:46:19 can
00:46:20 see the business and visualize it the
00:46:22 way the ceo does
00:46:24 then it's typically that you've got the
00:46:26 right variables so much for being here
00:46:28 um in dondo investor you advise the
00:46:32 reader to look for
00:46:33 low risk high uncertainty businesses and
00:46:35 i thought that was a
00:46:36 fascinating construct
00:46:39 but also last year in this class watch
00:46:42 the recording and you mentioned that you
00:46:44 hate retail
00:46:45 i'd be curious if you could go a little
00:46:47 bit more into that
00:46:48 analysis and kind of how you see the
00:46:51 retail landscape
00:46:52 let's say over the next decade or two
00:46:54 and then maybe if you could tie that in
00:46:56 with your observation about
00:46:58 this period that you see going until
00:47:01 perhaps the late uh 2020s early 2030s
00:47:05 but specifically you know how that low
00:47:07 risk high uncertainty formulation
00:47:10 links to how you see retail right now
00:47:13 you know um i hate retail
00:47:16 and arvind loves retail so if you ever
00:47:20 want the other point of view on why
00:47:21 retail is awesome
00:47:23 uh you should talk to arvind um
00:47:26 but uh yeah i've never i've never liked
00:47:29 i've never liked retail and one of the
00:47:31 things about investing is
00:47:36 this morning i was on a bike ride with
00:47:39 uh
00:47:40 uh another money manager uh and uh
00:47:44 you know he was saying to me that he
00:47:46 really doesn't get
00:47:48 these restaurants like he doesn't get
00:47:51 burger king he doesn't get
00:47:53 um you know dominoes and so on
00:47:57 and i try to explain some of those
00:47:59 businesses to him
00:48:00 you know makes the bike ride go quickly
00:48:03 but i also told him
00:48:04 i said you can have a very very happy
00:48:08 life
00:48:10 never ever understanding
00:48:13 what makes these like like he was his
00:48:16 complaint to me was
00:48:17 that he can understand starbucks really
00:48:20 well
00:48:22 okay and he he understands that the
00:48:24 substitution
00:48:26 options on starbucks for most humans
00:48:30 is pretty limited like if you get to a
00:48:33 routine you know nowadays we don't go to
00:48:34 work or whatever we get to a routine
00:48:36 you know you're not going to be
00:48:37 switching your coffee
00:48:40 uh every day to a different place or
00:48:41 whatever right you get to a routine
00:48:44 but you may change the place you have
00:48:47 lunch every day
00:48:49 okay so the recurrence of starbucks
00:48:53 and the recurrence of chipotle are not
00:48:56 the same
00:48:58 so that's i'm just telling you what so
00:48:59 his perspective was that if i look at
00:49:01 wendy's
00:49:02 you know there's so many options besides
00:49:05 wendy's when you go to eat
00:49:07 right and so so i told him listen
00:49:11 whether that framework is correct or
00:49:13 wrong
00:49:14 in terms of taking about pass on wendy's
00:49:17 it doesn't matter all that matters is
00:49:19 what you do invest in
00:49:22 so if you unfairly get rid of wendy's
00:49:25 because it might be a good business
00:49:26 because 90 plus percent franchise and
00:49:29 all that stuff
00:49:31 and they just introduced breakfast and
00:49:32 so on um
00:49:35 no issues so we're in a business of no
00:49:37 call strikes
00:49:38 okay so you can take entire
00:49:41 industries and say i'm not interested
00:49:45 and no there's no penalty so i have
00:49:49 taken
00:49:50 this entire industry of retail and
00:49:53 in one big lump just dumped it on the
00:49:55 side
00:49:56 um and we have arvind on the other hand
00:50:00 who's
00:50:00 pouring through each one okay and i
00:50:03 don't even want to pour through each one
00:50:05 i don't think the whole
00:50:06 chunk can just get rid of it as quickly
00:50:07 as possible in fact
00:50:09 even now i don't understand amazon's
00:50:12 retail business
00:50:14 i don't understand because i say that
00:50:15 the last mile is so expensive
00:50:18 you know like if i order like a seven
00:50:20 dollar item
00:50:22 they deliver to my doorstep the cost of
00:50:25 that has to be like
00:50:26 10 bucks 15 bucks just to get it to my
00:50:29 door i mean
00:50:30 all the things you have to go through um
00:50:34 but somehow amazon makes money and and
00:50:36 it probably works because not everything
00:50:37 i order will be seven dollars and so on
00:50:39 and so
00:50:40 statistically probably works out but the
00:50:42 thing is that i don't get it right
00:50:44 and so if i don't get it it doesn't
00:50:46 matter just let it go
00:50:48 so retail the problem with retail
00:50:50 traditional retail you know brick and
00:50:52 mortar retail is
00:50:55 it's the most transparent of businesses
00:50:59 and sam walton took advantage of that
00:51:02 so sam walton spent an incredible amount
00:51:05 of time
00:51:06 in his competitor's stores and
00:51:10 he would constantly i mean he would go
00:51:12 to any town any place he was going he'd
00:51:15 always take his team
00:51:16 into and it didn't even need to be the
00:51:19 big guys he would go to little stores
00:51:20 big stores
00:51:21 he was going all over the world right so
00:51:23 one time
00:51:25 uh in brazil there's a supermarket
00:51:28 and some old guys flat on the ground and
00:51:31 they call the paramedics
00:51:32 okay and then they find out it's sam
00:51:35 walton and
00:51:36 he wanted to measure the the space
00:51:39 between
00:51:40 aisles and he didn't have a tape measure
00:51:42 so he said i'll use my body
00:51:44 because i know how tall i am and so but
00:51:47 what i'm saying he was fanatical
00:51:50 about the inches between the aisles okay
00:51:52 so every minor thing
00:51:54 and so the problem in retail is that
00:51:57 there are no trade secrets okay
00:52:00 every single thing that you're doing
00:52:03 your competitors can just walk in
00:52:05 and get everything the second problem is
00:52:07 so if i look at a business like
00:52:09 let's say business like adp you know
00:52:11 payroll processing
00:52:13 how frequently do businesses change
00:52:17 their payroll processor let me just tell
00:52:19 you
00:52:21 i hate adp i use adp
00:52:24 i hate them why do i hate them i look at
00:52:27 all the costs i'm paying
00:52:28 and i'm saying it's ridiculous you know
00:52:30 it's a bunch of digital stuff they're
00:52:32 doing
00:52:33 and why do they charge me so much so i
00:52:35 every few years i
00:52:36 look to get out of adp
00:52:40 okay and then i figure out that yeah i
00:52:43 can do it middle of the year
00:52:44 and whatever they'll give to w-2s and
00:52:47 all that
00:52:48 but really for the employees what is
00:52:50 seamless is to do it just once
00:52:52 at the end of the year right so it's
00:52:55 it's simpler
00:52:56 so your switching is limited like one
00:52:58 day
00:52:59 okay and then the other guy i talked to
00:53:01 paychecks
00:53:03 there's no difference i i talk to the
00:53:06 paychecks guy and i'm not getting any
00:53:07 special deal then i go to like
00:53:09 you know smaller guys and then so in the
00:53:12 end i'm back to edp
00:53:14 okay and uh adp has something very
00:53:18 important
00:53:19 in my opinion one of the most important
00:53:20 things in business
00:53:22 is rrs
00:53:27 rrs recurring revenue streams
00:53:30 okay so recurring revenue streams rrs by
00:53:33 the way i made up
00:53:34 okay it's an acronym i just made up okay
00:53:37 so
00:53:38 recurring revenue streams is the holy
00:53:40 grail what we want in a business
00:53:42 we want franchises which are just
00:53:45 pounding the reason retail is such a
00:53:48 massive graveyard of all these companies
00:53:50 going under
00:53:51 is because the customer has no contract
00:53:55 with you
00:53:56 okay so i go to a kmart and if for
00:53:59 whatever reason i'm not very happy with
00:54:01 something or the other or someone else
00:54:02 offers something on sale
00:54:04 i don't need any obligation to go to
00:54:06 them i can go to someone else
00:54:07 it's totally different from adp i mean
00:54:11 adp they've got you they've got another
00:54:13 business there which is
00:54:14 uh automating these uh auto dealerships
00:54:17 you know every time you go to auto
00:54:18 dealer
00:54:19 and they pull up and they give you your
00:54:21 uh you know yours either your sale
00:54:23 contract
00:54:24 or your maintenance stuff all that is
00:54:26 running on a
00:54:27 i think it's fun of that company but
00:54:29 they're all based on adb all of these
00:54:30 businesses
00:54:31 that adp had with these recurring
00:54:33 revenue businesses
00:54:35 and so those businesses have another one
00:54:38 that they spun out
00:54:39 uh broadridge uh you know which sent out
00:54:42 all the filings uh
00:54:43 all these companies the public companies
00:54:45 that we send out to the investors and
00:54:47 all that
00:54:47 so broadridge gets paid
00:54:51 x per investor whether they send it
00:54:53 digitally on
00:54:54 in the mail okay what does it cost them
00:54:57 to send some digitally
00:54:58 zero okay approaching zero but they
00:55:01 still charge it's a great business
00:55:02 so what i'm trying to say is that retail
00:55:04 most retail
00:55:06 doesn't have those attributes okay now
00:55:09 there are retailers so for example when
00:55:12 i take this whole
00:55:14 industry and dump it what happens is
00:55:17 when i dump the industry part of the
00:55:19 dumping includes costco
00:55:21 okay and part of the dumping includes
00:55:24 amazon
00:55:24 okay and then you look or even walmart i
00:55:27 dump all of them
00:55:28 right and then i look at the stock chart
00:55:30 on these and it looks great
00:55:32 you know and so but you know the thing
00:55:35 is
00:55:36 i just find that even look at walmart i
00:55:38 say it's it's a business that does
00:55:41 well but they need to be so
00:55:44 good costco needs to be so good now
00:55:48 costco
00:55:49 has so much goodwill with its customers
00:55:52 and
00:55:52 so much that they do for their customers
00:55:55 that that mode
00:55:56 is very solid you know finally i
00:55:59 i think i understand costco's mode but i
00:56:02 understand it at 40 times earnings i did
00:56:04 not understand it at eight times
00:56:05 earnings or whatever
00:56:06 right so it's okay that train has left
00:56:09 the station
00:56:10 no problem there are a million trains
00:56:13 yet to come
00:56:15 so what i find is that when i look at
00:56:17 these businesses home depot and costco
00:56:19 and
00:56:20 walmart and all this stuff they are very
00:56:23 good businesses
00:56:24 but what is hidden beneath the surface
00:56:28 is these businesses require incredible
00:56:30 execution
00:56:32 and they have to every day win back
00:56:36 the loyalty of their customers uh
00:56:39 because you know there's constant
00:56:41 erosion taking place
00:56:43 from new entrants right i mean amazon
00:56:45 comes in and no matter how well walmart
00:56:48 executes
00:56:49 they've got it's a paradigm shift and
00:56:51 and it's difficult so walmart has to
00:56:53 kind of
00:56:54 change the way it is so i think i think
00:56:56 retail is
00:56:57 is i find very hard and
00:57:00 so in general i'm not interested and and
00:57:03 actually you know one of the things is
00:57:04 if you look at
00:57:07 if you look at someone like buffett and
00:57:09 look at something like berkshire
00:57:10 hathaway
00:57:11 berkshire hathaway has made lots of
00:57:14 retail investments
00:57:16 okay they bought many many jewelers
00:57:19 and they bought many many furniture guys
00:57:23 okay now if you look at warren's track
00:57:25 record when he invests in financials
00:57:28 or when you invest in banks or anything
00:57:31 like that it's a
00:57:33 it's he's batting a thousand it's a
00:57:36 flawless record he
00:57:37 just i don't i've never seen him lose
00:57:40 money
00:57:41 investing in a bank he's really really
00:57:43 good at it
00:57:44 uh but uh in retail
00:57:47 uh berkshire i mean they don't talk
00:57:50 about it because
00:57:51 he doesn't want to you know
00:57:54 have the managers loot or lose all
00:57:55 motivation uh
00:57:57 but it's a graveyard basically i think
00:58:00 every
00:58:01 furniture operation they bought other
00:58:04 than nebraska furniture mart
00:58:06 did not work every jewelry operation
00:58:09 they bought
00:58:10 other than borsheims did not work and on
00:58:13 and on so they made
00:58:14 they made a lot of forays into retail
00:58:18 and by and large they didn't work now it
00:58:19 didn't matter to berkshire because
00:58:21 by and large they've been small relative
00:58:23 to the size of berkshire
00:58:25 and they carry a lot of those businesses
00:58:27 and it's okay
00:58:29 uh but it didn't work so well to clarify
00:58:32 manisha's reference to my retail love is
00:58:35 really a costco
00:58:36 love so i don't want oh i think irwin
00:58:38 that goes beyond costco
00:58:41 costco costco is like a torrid affair
00:58:46 okay costco is not just an affair to
00:58:49 costco has like gone off the charts but
00:58:50 the others are still there
00:58:52 costco there's still some love with the
00:58:55 others
00:58:56 costco is more like my wife there's just
00:58:59 my wife
00:59:00 and i make sure she can't hear that
00:59:05 i don't know i don't know i do not
00:59:07 appreciate that
00:59:10 being inflated to costco
00:59:12 [Laughter]
00:59:14 i think she may love costco
00:59:24 thank you for being here um as a south
00:59:27 asian immigrant obviously i enjoyed
00:59:29 uh the dundo investor so thanks again
00:59:32 i was curious you mentioned earlier in
00:59:34 your remarks you know 50
00:59:36 000 stocks you clearly have breadth
00:59:37 across geography and industries and
00:59:39 business models
00:59:41 where do you start so what is top of
00:59:43 funnel for you
00:59:45 especially since it seems like with the
00:59:47 50 cent and exited 90 cent strategy
00:59:50 you have far more velocity and sort of
00:59:52 your portfolio
00:59:53 than many other value investors i've
00:59:55 sort of read about and
00:59:57 spoken with well hopefully that velocity
01:00:00 is going to zero soon
01:00:02 um that's where we want to get to uh
01:00:06 you know so when buffett is asked that
01:00:08 question
01:00:09 he says start with the a's
01:00:12 okay but i'll try to give you a better
01:00:15 answer than warren
01:00:16 um so uh there are some hacks
01:00:20 so 50 000 stocks is a lot and and
01:00:22 actually when warren says start with the
01:00:24 a's he's not kidding
01:00:26 because he went through the moody's
01:00:28 manual
01:00:30 you know every page and you know the
01:00:32 movies manual they stopped publishing
01:00:34 that
01:00:34 several decades ago so i bought a few of
01:00:36 those on ebay just to get a
01:00:38 feel for you know what the messiah used
01:00:41 and yeah
01:00:42 it's pretty dense stuff i mean got like
01:00:44 four or five businesses per page
01:00:45 a very small fine print and he went
01:00:47 through all that um
01:00:49 and and so his and uh
01:00:52 lilu's done the same thing so definitely
01:00:56 uh you can put your nose to the
01:00:57 grindstone and you can start pounding
01:01:00 through these businesses
01:01:01 uh and you know i tried to get
01:01:05 warren interested in capital iq
01:01:09 you know i said warren you know you one
01:01:11 time i was in his office and he was
01:01:12 going through the japan company handbook
01:01:14 and i said warren you know if we if we
01:01:18 get you to splurge on capital iq you can
01:01:22 run screens and this and that and
01:01:25 i even got to showing
01:01:29 uh one of his assistants kind of you
01:01:32 know how to do all that and everything
01:01:34 and
01:01:36 he's not going to spend that money he
01:01:39 wants his 50
01:01:41 book and that's what all he wants um so
01:01:44 anyway and it's worked just fine for him
01:01:46 but but you can hack this a little bit
01:01:48 so
01:01:49 one one way i hack it is you can look at
01:01:52 what other great investors have bought
01:01:54 okay so you can make a list of uh
01:01:57 investors and
01:01:58 it's interesting to actually uh
01:02:00 categorize them so
01:02:02 if you look at someone like chuck akri
01:02:03 you'll see a certain pattern to what he
01:02:05 buys
01:02:06 you look at david tepper you see some
01:02:08 different patterns or
01:02:10 you look at you know you know jeff urban
01:02:13 and so on so you can you can find
01:02:15 different
01:02:16 patterns with the different investors
01:02:18 and you know dataroma does a good job of
01:02:21 giving you a whole bunch of investors
01:02:22 and what they own
01:02:23 such pretty easily the price is right
01:02:25 it's zero
01:02:26 um so that can take that fifty thousand
01:02:30 share uh the the 50 000 stocks
01:02:36 down by more than 90
01:02:40 maybe even 98 okay
01:02:43 and and then the the second the second
01:02:46 hack you can do
01:02:48 is uh you know the first question i ask
01:02:51 myself when i look at a business is
01:02:53 is it within circular competence you
01:02:56 know so you can winnow that
01:02:57 list down different ways um you could
01:03:00 run screens for
01:03:02 you know low p's or whatever but i think
01:03:04 that
01:03:05 looking at what other great investors
01:03:06 are one of the good is a good filter
01:03:08 um because already gone through one
01:03:10 filter especially if they're larger
01:03:12 holdings
01:03:13 uh then the second question you ask to
01:03:14 ask yourself is is it within circle of
01:03:16 competence
01:03:18 and that will take out quite a few
01:03:19 businesses as well
01:03:21 so and then you know if you do if you're
01:03:23 like me like you know
01:03:24 anything retail gone you know anything
01:03:26 financial is gone
01:03:28 right you just have these um you know
01:03:32 anything pharma gone healthcare gone you
01:03:34 know all of that so i
01:03:35 i can take out um a lot of stuff
01:03:38 relatively quickly
01:03:40 and it doesn't matter if i'm doing this
01:03:42 mass
01:03:43 stuff and there's good stuff going away
01:03:45 there's not there's no penalty for that
01:03:47 uh this infinite amount of good stuff so
01:03:49 you can keep throwing away a lot of
01:03:51 stuff
01:03:52 and and then you get down to uh
01:03:55 some things that you know strike your
01:03:57 fancy or
01:03:59 you get interested in and then you go
01:04:00 deep
01:04:02 feel free to jump in i saw vishal rusty
01:04:05 sam
01:04:05 all had questions um sorry to take us
01:04:09 back a couple
01:04:10 questions but uh to kind of piggyback
01:04:13 off what
01:04:14 frank had mentioned as far as valuations
01:04:17 a lot of your investments
01:04:18 are emerging markets overseas where
01:04:21 accounting standards aren't exactly
01:04:23 aren't exactly a thing
01:04:25 management may be a little bit more
01:04:26 difficult to get in touch with
01:04:28 so what sort of extra legwork do you
01:04:31 have to go through in order to make
01:04:33 your investments and arrive at an
01:04:35 investment decision
01:04:37 i think most of the international stuff
01:04:39 i think
01:04:42 i've i've usually had to go see the
01:04:44 business
01:04:45 and kick the tires and assess the
01:04:48 management
01:04:49 and so on so it's uh it's definitely
01:04:53 involved more work but it's a lot of fun
01:04:57 work actually i enjoy that
01:04:59 so yeah you you do have a few more
01:05:01 layers to peel
01:05:04 as you go from i mean one of the things
01:05:07 i don't have to worry too much about is
01:05:09 that
01:05:10 um i think the odds that i would lose
01:05:14 odds that i would lose money in the u.s
01:05:16 on an investment
01:05:18 because of fraud uh approach zero
01:05:22 we you know they make the headlines here
01:05:24 and there
01:05:25 the enrons and stuff but the odds that
01:05:27 something like that
01:05:28 enters your portfolio is very low
01:05:31 especially if you're then
01:05:32 doing research and work on it and you
01:05:34 understand the business you know i think
01:05:36 something like enron would be just
01:05:37 beyond my understanding you know so
01:05:39 a pretty easy pass you know if i can
01:05:43 understand
01:05:43 amazon you know enron is very far from
01:05:45 that
01:05:46 so so basically i think
01:05:50 uh yeah you you have a little more work
01:05:52 to do
01:05:53 but you also have more rewards in the
01:05:55 sense that sometimes the tailwinds can
01:05:57 be a lot stronger
01:05:59 uh and and i think i think that uh
01:06:03 you know i think in general
01:06:07 entrepreneurs around the world um
01:06:10 you know most of them are trying to
01:06:15 uh you know make a go at it fairly
01:06:18 honestly
01:06:19 um i think that's a that's a general
01:06:22 trade across and
01:06:23 uh and yeah you do have to kind of
01:06:26 check that box and test it a little
01:06:28 carefully
01:06:29 but you can get there not a problem i
01:06:31 can go um
01:06:34 manish thank you so much for doing this
01:06:35 this is so much fun
01:06:37 so far um my uh i have two quick
01:06:40 questions for you
01:06:42 uh you mentioned earlier that you've
01:06:43 learned a lot
01:06:45 during this pandemic i was just curious
01:06:48 to
01:06:49 um learn more about like how you managed
01:06:52 your portfolio during the pandemic or
01:06:54 managing your portfolio
01:06:56 and what have you learned so far uh and
01:06:59 my second
01:07:00 question is um so we had
01:07:03 someone from fidelity last week and uh
01:07:07 um the portfolio manager told us that a
01:07:11 lot of
01:07:12 people currently are investing in growth
01:07:14 um
01:07:15 i'm just wondering if value investing is
01:07:17 dead
01:07:18 uh or is it that uh like do you still
01:07:21 believe that
01:07:21 uh value investing has uh a place
01:07:25 uh today i think uh yeah i think
01:07:28 uh regarding the pandemic so a couple of
01:07:32 things
01:07:33 i mean i think in the march time frame
01:07:38 when this data was kind of coming out
01:07:41 about you know kind of how big this was
01:07:44 going to be
01:07:44 and the shutdowns were starting and so
01:07:47 on
01:07:48 uh i was trying to understand kind of
01:07:51 you know
01:07:52 what kind of impacts it would have on
01:07:54 the existing portfolio
01:07:57 so the thing is that capitalism is very
01:08:00 brutal
01:08:01 and in the best of times
01:08:04 most businesses are very fragile um
01:08:07 so they most businesses cannot withstand
01:08:13 uh the kind of shock uh of
01:08:16 these shutdowns and stuff most
01:08:17 businesses cannot handle that
01:08:19 it's um it's it's really hard
01:08:22 and so for example but i think when i
01:08:25 looked at
01:08:26 my portfolio um
01:08:30 you know like for example i i own some
01:08:33 real estate companies in india so these
01:08:36 businesses they don't have much leverage
01:08:38 their sales velocity was going to go
01:08:40 down but i didn't have any concern about
01:08:43 stability of the business i said yeah
01:08:44 you know they'll have less sales and
01:08:46 they've got some
01:08:47 like explained nvr they've got some
01:08:49 corporate overhead
01:08:50 and can they handle that i said yeah
01:08:52 that's not a problem for them to handle
01:08:53 the overhead
01:08:54 so i was not concerned about those
01:08:56 businesses
01:08:57 um i uh i i got
01:09:01 quite concerned about one of our
01:09:04 companies you know fiat chrysler
01:09:06 uh because the the car business is so
01:09:09 much operating leverage
01:09:11 and uh and and when you shut down a car
01:09:14 plant
01:09:15 uh i mean it's you've taken that whole
01:09:18 thing in reverse
01:09:20 so i actually could not see
01:09:23 i was very concerned about how this is
01:09:26 going to
01:09:27 affect them how long it's going to last
01:09:30 etc
01:09:30 and so we completely exited
01:09:34 the position um and i exited at
01:09:38 a significant discount to where it was
01:09:40 trading
01:09:41 before uh the pandemic and even now i
01:09:44 mean it's
01:09:45 it's come back in a manner that was
01:09:46 different from the way i expected so if
01:09:49 i had done nothing i would have been
01:09:50 better off but i couldn't see it it was
01:09:52 the uncertainty levels are way too high
01:09:55 and i had seen that business have
01:09:58 trouble
01:09:59 uh in the past so we didn't take a lot
01:10:01 of actions
01:10:02 in the portfolio we took some actions um
01:10:05 but on the flip side what also happened
01:10:07 at that time was
01:10:09 there were great opportunities uh so
01:10:12 especially in march
01:10:14 you know towards the end of march when
01:10:16 the markets were tanking
01:10:18 um we were able to put
01:10:22 money to work and uh so i made two
01:10:24 investments and uh
01:10:27 they done very well so and i'm very
01:10:29 happy that we made those so
01:10:30 uh so the pandemic i think is uh
01:10:34 is now i think we it's a little bit more
01:10:38 there's more clarity about it and
01:10:42 it's still going to last for quite a
01:10:44 while i think that it'll take a while
01:10:46 because uh we need to get to the point
01:10:50 where
01:10:51 um in effect people have
01:10:54 some kind of certificate or passport or
01:10:56 something which
01:10:58 says i'm vaccinated and whatever and
01:11:01 and such and and you know for business
01:11:05 to come back and business
01:11:06 people to have meetings everyone needs
01:11:09 to have that sort of thing
01:11:10 uh in place so that will take a while
01:11:13 and so i think uh
01:11:15 but we are already finding in california
01:11:18 for example the
01:11:19 the freeways are getting clogged up and
01:11:21 you know so things things are coming
01:11:24 if they have nots um i mean this is this
01:11:27 is really stressed they have not since
01:11:29 really
01:11:31 unfortunately widened the gap between
01:11:33 the haves and have-nots it's a very
01:11:35 uh sad thing in terms of what's happened
01:11:36 with the pandemic in terms of
01:11:39 who it's impacted uh growth and value
01:11:42 are joined at the hip
01:11:44 there's no difference all
01:11:47 intelligent investing is value investing
01:11:50 so
01:11:50 if a company is growing all that means
01:11:53 is that you've got more
01:11:54 coupons in the future and they've got
01:11:56 higher coupons and then you discount
01:11:58 them
01:11:59 to whatever rate so it doesn't matter
01:12:02 whether those coupons are growing at 20
01:12:04 a year
01:12:05 or they're growing at zero percent a
01:12:07 year or they're declining five percent a
01:12:09 year
01:12:09 all three cases will give you a
01:12:11 valuation on which
01:12:13 uh you can invest you're better off
01:12:16 having high return on equity and high
01:12:20 growth
01:12:20 in general that's really what's gonna
01:12:24 uh and long runways with that but i
01:12:27 don't particularly see it
01:12:28 as one is different from the other
01:12:32 i think if you if i have a choice
01:12:37 i want to invest in growth
01:12:41 and and anyway i i told you that you
01:12:44 know the
01:12:45 50 to 90 cents is not of as much
01:12:47 interest
01:12:49 i want to get to the long runways and
01:12:51 such so
01:12:52 um but i want to get to the wrong
01:12:55 runways without paying up too much
01:12:57 so thank you for uh for joining us today
01:13:00 um my question for you uh relates to one
01:13:02 of the points that you
01:13:04 made in your book that when i read it a
01:13:06 couple years ago i thought was really
01:13:07 brilliant which is that
01:13:08 embedded options tend to be mispriced
01:13:11 um since i read that you know it's
01:13:13 something i've been on the lookout for
01:13:15 uh for a few years now and one of the
01:13:17 things that i've observed
01:13:18 is that uh actually these things tend to
01:13:21 be understood
01:13:23 at least in the businesses that i've
01:13:24 looked at so i'm wondering whether you
01:13:26 think
01:13:26 um that's a concept that now tends to be
01:13:28 more widely understood by the markets or
01:13:30 whether
01:13:31 you still find options that are in fact
01:13:33 mispriced
01:13:35 you're you're talking of the optionality
01:13:38 in a business in a business right
01:13:40 exactly i mean i think i think that that
01:13:42 persists
01:13:43 um always i mean uh
01:13:48 markets markets uh don't
01:13:51 like um these kind of
01:13:54 wide outcome ranges you know i i think
01:13:58 what what markets are really good as
01:13:59 they want to see a cookie cutter
01:14:01 and they want to be able to see uh you
01:14:04 know what that cookie cutter can do over
01:14:05 a long period of time
01:14:06 and they want a straight line right so
01:14:10 if i have a business like costco uh you
01:14:12 know that gets
01:14:14 as much as like a cookie cutter as you
01:14:16 can imagine right they they have a
01:14:18 pretty well-defined model they do
01:14:20 innovate within that model but
01:14:22 they know the path they're going down
01:14:23 and i mean i would say
01:14:26 um optionality on costco would be like
01:14:29 you know they're
01:14:30 in such a small number of countries
01:14:33 uh they could expand that quite
01:14:36 dramatically
01:14:36 china just started for them um
01:14:40 and so on but you know uh it's also
01:14:42 richly priced so
01:14:43 uh i think that i find
01:14:47 that what markets don't appreciate
01:14:52 because most markets participants
01:14:55 did not run businesses or have not run
01:14:58 businesses
01:15:00 is they don't appreciate the messiness
01:15:02 of the real world
01:15:03 and they don't like the messiness of the
01:15:05 real world and so that actually gives
01:15:08 an advantage to an investor who
01:15:11 appreciates that
01:15:12 so the reality we know in businesses is
01:15:15 that things don't go in a straight line
01:15:17 and that you're going to have ups and
01:15:19 downs and
01:15:20 that businesses will open
01:15:24 up brand new things that you never
01:15:26 imagined
01:15:28 you know was not part of the model like
01:15:29 starbucks starts
01:15:31 reserve right so they're going to go
01:15:33 higher end on the coffee
01:15:35 or even starts uh serving alcohol
01:15:39 for example you know so those if those
01:15:42 kind of
01:15:42 tangents work it changes the paradigm
01:15:45 but the market's not willing to
01:15:47 recognize those typically uh because
01:15:50 they see a lot of uncertainty with those
01:15:51 so yes
01:15:52 uh if you can if you can figure out
01:15:57 uh optionality of the business and you
01:15:59 can handicap the probabilities
01:16:01 uh of the optionality or you're not
01:16:03 paying for it at all you know
01:16:05 you're paying for the core business
01:16:07 you're not paying for the optionality
01:16:09 uh then those those can be really good
01:16:11 absolutely
01:16:15 um like one of the things i didn't i
01:16:18 didn't appreciate but
01:16:19 came out later was that like when we
01:16:22 bought
01:16:22 fiat chrysler for example in 2012
01:16:26 i was just looking at this as a
01:16:29 a car business with a great ceo
01:16:32 who was going to right the ship and if
01:16:35 you right to the ship they would make a
01:16:37 few billion dollars a year
01:16:39 and the market cap would go to four or
01:16:42 five times
01:16:42 what it was what i did not appreciate
01:16:45 about
01:16:46 about fear chrysler was that
01:16:50 i knew that for example ferrari was
01:16:52 embedded inside the company
01:16:55 but at that time when i made the
01:16:57 investment ferrari was making
01:16:59 less than 150 million a year
01:17:04 and i said okay you know well you know
01:17:06 you can give this a 15 multiple or
01:17:08 something and
01:17:09 you know it's it's got maybe a couple of
01:17:12 billion of value or something but
01:17:14 it's not going to what i was looking at
01:17:16 is that
01:17:17 can this 5 6 billion get to 30 billion
01:17:19 for example right and i could see that
01:17:22 the core business could get to that
01:17:24 right but
01:17:25 i just dis dismissed ferrari
01:17:28 and uh and as it turned out i mean
01:17:32 uh that that ferrari portion
01:17:36 uh that we we in effect
01:17:40 paid um when i bought the thing
01:17:43 we paid about 16
01:17:47 a share for ferrari inside fiat chrysler
01:17:50 and it went to 200 you know 190 or 200
01:17:54 right
01:17:54 and uh so and and it was one third
01:17:59 eventually got one third of the value so
01:18:01 uh it
01:18:02 it did way better than the rest of the
01:18:04 other pieces
01:18:05 and then they had a they had a parts
01:18:07 that they had several parts businesses
01:18:09 which they got rid of and spun out and
01:18:11 so on so there was a lot of stuff that
01:18:12 came out of
01:18:13 fiat chrysler which was not part of my
01:18:16 original analysis
01:18:17 and i just said okay you know we've got
01:18:20 a gifted manager
01:18:21 and he's going to make sure that we get
01:18:25 good value from these pieces so the
01:18:27 optionality there
01:18:29 was not even something i was focused on
01:18:31 but then i after a few years i realized
01:18:33 there's a lot of different pieces here
01:18:35 that i haven't accounted for
01:18:37 and that worked out very good so i was
01:18:40 wondering
01:18:41 um you've talked about long runways and
01:18:44 i was just wondering
01:18:45 how do you find long runways and where
01:18:47 do you see long runways
01:18:49 forward on long runways is arvind
01:18:53 that's what you need to do you need to
01:18:55 put your arms around irvine then ask him
01:18:57 uh he's hard to do that in a coveted
01:19:00 world
01:19:00 he's he's a mr long runway guy it's his
01:19:04 full name is
01:19:05 arvind long runway navaratram you know
01:19:08 it's a middle name um i mean i think
01:19:12 i think that
01:19:17 it's a really good question and i think
01:19:19 the
01:19:21 the best way i can answer that is that
01:19:24 um if you
01:19:28 if you make 10 bets
01:19:32 or you know carefully selected all with
01:19:35 long runway that leads your perception
01:19:38 that they have long runway so one of the
01:19:39 problems with long runways is that
01:19:42 you know i already told you capitalism
01:19:44 is very brutal you know i mean there's
01:19:46 all these forces
01:19:47 coming from left field and center and
01:19:51 everywhere else
01:19:52 trying to chip away at any competitive
01:19:54 advantage right
01:19:55 so people look at people look at adp
01:19:59 and they look at that incredible moat
01:20:01 and they want to constantly hammer
01:20:03 against that move
01:20:04 or people look at visa and mastercard
01:20:06 and look at that mode and they want to
01:20:07 go
01:20:08 keep going against that mode and
01:20:11 many times they will succeed they will
01:20:14 succeed at
01:20:15 collapsing that mode that's the nature
01:20:17 of i mean
01:20:18 if you look at you know dominant
01:20:20 businesses 50 years ago
01:20:22 100 years ago even 30 years ago
01:20:26 how many of those are dominant today you
01:20:28 know i mean
01:20:29 most most have gone by the wayside
01:20:32 uh because capitalism is really hard but
01:20:35 if you if you if you make
01:20:38 eight or ten bets and you know you're
01:20:42 careful on the valuation what you're
01:20:44 willing to pay
01:20:45 and you are convinced that the modes are
01:20:48 quite resilient
01:20:51 even if you're wrong 40 of the time
01:20:56 you will still end up very wealthy
01:21:00 um so you're not going to bat
01:21:03 a hundred percent on the long runway
01:21:06 game
01:21:07 i mean look at look at uh warren and
01:21:10 charlie
01:21:11 all they're doing is trying to buy long
01:21:13 runways but if you looked at
01:21:15 every acquisition berkshire has made and
01:21:17 you equal weight every acquisition
01:21:20 i would say easily a third have not
01:21:22 worked
01:21:24 right now if you dollar weight probably
01:21:27 80 90 percent have worked
01:21:30 but if you equal weighted a lot of the
01:21:32 decisions
01:21:33 didn't work and these are the gods of
01:21:36 investing
01:21:37 right so so we're gonna have mistakes
01:21:41 we're going to have
01:21:42 things that we think are going to work
01:21:44 and they won't work
01:21:45 but if you i mean bottom line is that
01:21:50 if you make 10 bets and
01:21:53 each one is 10 percent and
01:21:57 one of them becomes a thirty bagger
01:22:01 and you know three or four go by the
01:22:03 wayside and some of them are you know
01:22:05 five or ten baggers over a
01:22:06 20 30 year period you'll do just fine
01:22:11 so i have a question uh kind of on that
01:22:13 topic about moats
01:22:14 um when you're assessing moats is it
01:22:16 more
01:22:17 uh conceptually or do you do it um more
01:22:21 analytically and how confident in uh in
01:22:23 a moat
01:22:24 do you have to be to ultimately invest
01:22:26 in that company
01:22:27 it should be very obvious to you
01:22:30 i think you should be able to look at it
01:22:32 and and you should have very high degree
01:22:34 so
01:22:35 i mean let's say let's say we look at a
01:22:38 business
01:22:39 like starbucks right so i mean if you
01:22:42 were investing in starbucks the big
01:22:44 question is that
01:22:45 you know what does this company look
01:22:47 like 20 years from now
01:22:49 or 10 years from now you know is the
01:22:52 mote intact are people still going in
01:22:54 who are their competitors at that point
01:22:56 i mean these are the questions you need
01:22:57 to answer
01:22:58 you know how big the runway is how far
01:23:01 they can go
01:23:02 what can happen and there's a you know
01:23:04 there's a range of outcomes but
01:23:06 you need to be convinced
01:23:07 probabilistically that
01:23:09 most of that is skewed towards a great
01:23:11 answer
01:23:12 um and if you look at if you look at a
01:23:16 business like
01:23:17 chipotle for example you know a lot of
01:23:19 people will look at chipotle and say you
01:23:21 know
01:23:24 you know what's the difference between
01:23:25 chipotle and some you know taco stand
01:23:27 somewhere
01:23:28 and i think there's a difference i think
01:23:31 there's a big difference between
01:23:33 most almost all mexican restaurants and
01:23:35 chipotle
01:23:36 uh and they've in my opinion they've
01:23:38 widened and deepened the moat i mean
01:23:41 in their app is great they've
01:23:44 in the pandemic done a really good job
01:23:46 with
01:23:47 keeping the business profitable with
01:23:49 deliveries and
01:23:50 you know all of that i mean the dining
01:23:52 rooms are shut down but they've been
01:23:53 able to survive all that
01:23:55 and and the infinite
01:23:59 customization you can do on it so
01:24:02 there's a number of things there but
01:24:04 again the question would be you know
01:24:06 when you look out 10 years
01:24:08 15 years what does that business look
01:24:10 like you know
01:24:12 does it it does it become chipotle's all
01:24:15 over europe
01:24:16 all over asia all over latin america is
01:24:18 that does that happen
01:24:20 what are the probabilities that are
01:24:21 happening who else have
01:24:23 entered the space will they keep
01:24:24 executing you know
01:24:26 what will be their ros in the future or
01:24:28 there's a whole bunch of things that
01:24:29 come up so i think what i'm saying is
01:24:31 that
01:24:31 you've got to start out with admiring
01:24:34 the business and the more like you've
01:24:36 got to intrinsically know that
01:24:38 like even before i look at any adp
01:24:40 numbers i know it's a great business
01:24:42 okay even before i look at any visa
01:24:44 numbers i know it's a great business
01:24:46 right uh so first thing is you've got to
01:24:49 mentally have a kind of framework in
01:24:51 your head
01:24:52 that tells you yes i i
01:24:55 like this business and i think it's
01:24:57 great um
01:24:59 uh i think that businesses like chipotle
01:25:03 are harder because they don't have
01:25:06 recurring revenue and all these things i
01:25:08 think
01:25:10 some businesses like adp may have more
01:25:12 resilience because even if there's a
01:25:14 disrupter
01:25:16 businesses are not going to be
01:25:20 wanting to change payroll quickly
01:25:23 because it's such a small portion of
01:25:25 their costs
01:25:27 like i mean for me that you know messing
01:25:30 around with payroll
01:25:31 makes no economic sense okay
01:25:35 it just irritates me so i go down these
01:25:37 you know irrational paths
01:25:39 but basically for most businesses it's
01:25:41 not worth the time of day
01:25:43 it's payroll is running fine leave it
01:25:46 alone right
01:25:47 and so so those businesses have a much
01:25:50 higher degree of resilience in my
01:25:51 opinion
01:25:53 than a chipotle right because there
01:25:55 you've got to keep earning the customers
01:25:58 uh confidence and trust every day and
01:26:01 and so on so i think uh
01:26:03 mods come in so many wide widely
01:26:05 different shapes and sizes
01:26:08 and you know all kinds of things happen
01:26:10 you know boeing
01:26:12 what an incredible moat and then
01:26:15 all hell breaks loose you know so
01:26:18 um i mean if you looked at boeing three
01:26:21 or four years ago
01:26:23 you would say this is unbelievable
01:26:24 they've got this huge pipeline
01:26:26 they don't produce a white tail i mean
01:26:29 just like
01:26:30 nvr doesn't produce a home that's not
01:26:32 already sold
01:26:33 boeing doesn't produce an airplane that
01:26:35 isn't already sold
01:26:36 right so there's no whitetails and
01:26:39 they've got a big order book
01:26:41 and they're a duopoly
01:26:44 and you know and they've got a great
01:26:47 defense business and all that it's just
01:26:49 it's an incredible business but
01:26:53 look where we are you know so such is
01:26:56 life
01:26:57 so thanks for being here too it's it's
01:26:59 really great to have you here
01:27:00 um my question is more on the
01:27:04 on the selling side um
01:27:06 [Music]
01:27:08 you talk about you talked earlier about
01:27:09 uh the fifty to ninety percent
01:27:11 and you sell at ninety percent
01:27:12 interesting value now we're talking
01:27:14 about long
01:27:14 runways but you keep on looking for new
01:27:16 business opportunities i'm sure as well
01:27:18 at one point do you say you know what i
01:27:21 thought this was a good business
01:27:22 i think it has has good growth
01:27:24 opportunities but you know i got this
01:27:26 business here that i'm looking at it
01:27:27 looks like it's more valuable how do you
01:27:29 how do you go about this
01:27:30 part it's probably selling off i don't
01:27:33 know how you do it but
01:27:34 do you sell good good positions for what
01:27:37 you think might be even better
01:27:39 yeah it's all it's all opportunity cost
01:27:41 i think those are
01:27:42 those are why you get paid the big bucks
01:27:45 i think that's
01:27:47 you have to continuously do that uh but
01:27:50 you but you know it's a
01:27:52 it's a difficult exercise because the
01:27:55 mistress
01:27:55 always looks harder than the wife
01:27:59 you know and actually the wife may be
01:28:03 hotter but you think the mistress is
01:28:04 harder
01:28:06 you know so you've got to make sure that
01:28:09 the mistress is actually harder
01:28:11 not just that you think it's that way
01:28:15 so anything that we know really well
01:28:19 we also know all the blemishes really
01:28:21 well
01:28:22 right and this new shiny thing on the
01:28:26 side
01:28:28 we don't know all the blemishes yet you
01:28:31 know so that's one of the things is that
01:28:32 the
01:28:33 greater your familiarity with the
01:28:35 business
01:28:37 um the greater your familiarity is going
01:28:39 to be with all the
01:28:40 like like you know arvin's probably
01:28:42 really really familiar with all the
01:28:44 negative
01:28:45 issues with costco okay he knows those
01:28:48 really well
01:28:50 uh even i mean i don't even i can't
01:28:52 believe costco has anything negative but
01:28:54 whatever negative there is are winds
01:28:55 away
01:28:58 uh i'm sorry what long lines
01:29:01 oh yeah long lines yeah yeah you know
01:29:03 like every time i pass
01:29:04 a costco gas station i think i'm in some
01:29:08 socialist country
01:29:10 you know i think i'm in russia 30 years
01:29:13 ago or something
01:29:14 you know i think why in a capitalist
01:29:16 society
01:29:17 do we have these long lines for gas you
01:29:20 know but that's the way it is such as
01:29:21 life
01:29:22 um yeah so i think you have to be
01:29:25 careful
01:29:26 that you don't fall into the mistress
01:29:28 trap
01:29:29 and uh as long as uh you are genuinely
01:29:32 looking at something that is better than
01:29:35 what you own
01:29:35 better value than what you own and and
01:29:38 you know you consider the tax
01:29:40 implications and all of that
01:29:42 uh you know my i have a good friend
01:29:45 guy spear and
01:29:47 [Music]
01:29:50 another friend of mine the way he
01:29:51 describes guy is he says he has the
01:29:54 highest return of any investor on the
01:29:57 planet
01:29:58 based on effort expended
01:30:02 okay on on on every hour
01:30:06 of effort expended guy is off the charts
01:30:09 okay uh so the thing with guy
01:30:12 is that any time and i bounce a lot of
01:30:15 ideas off him anytime i bring up
01:30:17 any new idea to him
01:30:21 it doesn't matter how good it is
01:30:24 he is not changing anything
01:30:27 so i tell him guy listen you've got
01:30:31 nestle okay nestle is done
01:30:34 okay 30 40 times earnings whatever done
01:30:38 okay we've got this thing at three times
01:30:40 earnings which has got this massive
01:30:42 runway
01:30:44 can we please sell nestle please and i
01:30:48 get nowhere
01:30:50 he's not willing to make
01:30:53 any changes okay and then after i keep
01:30:55 badgering him over and over and over
01:30:58 uh he'll buy two percent okay and uh
01:31:02 and and that's it you know and uh uh
01:31:05 like you know uh i mean he loves
01:31:10 long runways okay he loves deep modes
01:31:14 he loves all these things so
01:31:17 i told him about mao tai
01:31:21 okay i mean great brand blah blah blah
01:31:24 also i said this is it guy i know you
01:31:27 don't like all the i bring to you
01:31:29 but this is like a real runway
01:31:32 he says i'm not buying any chinese
01:31:34 company
01:31:35 i'm not going i said it's fine there's
01:31:38 no issues there
01:31:40 fifty percent payout all this stuff good
01:31:42 governance blah blah okay
01:31:44 he's i'm not going there okay and then i
01:31:47 kept badgering him
01:31:48 and i think he put like a hundred
01:31:50 thousand dollars into it just to get me
01:31:51 off
01:31:52 his back and then after a few years
01:31:57 we went to china together and we visited
01:32:01 maotai headquarters and then he says
01:32:04 and you know by that time it's now gone
01:32:06 up about five times
01:32:08 and then the whole trip was oh i missed
01:32:11 this
01:32:12 oh i should have bought this i said do
01:32:15 you remember
01:32:16 do you remember all the calls i made and
01:32:18 i was pounding pounding and i couldn't
01:32:20 get through
01:32:21 oh yeah i don't know what it was
01:32:22 happening this is such a no-brainer this
01:32:24 is so easy blah blah blah
01:32:26 you know so but what but you know
01:32:28 actually in action
01:32:31 in action is what saves sky
01:32:36 so the best thing that you can do
01:32:39 is don't make switches if it's 60 40.
01:32:44 don't make switches if it's you know
01:32:45 this is a little bit better
01:32:47 and i'll make the switch no make the
01:32:49 switch
01:32:51 hurdle really high like the mistress has
01:32:54 to be
01:32:55 really really hot okay not
01:32:58 just better than the wife okay they're
01:33:00 all better than the wife
01:33:01 but really hot and then you're fine
01:33:04 [Music]
01:33:06 about competitive advantages um so you
01:33:09 have a role of only investing in
01:33:11 copycats
01:33:12 as opposed to innovators um so my
01:33:15 question is do you believe that there's
01:33:17 a first mover advantage
01:33:20 that's a really good question um
01:33:24 so i think that one of the mental models
01:33:28 which has served me really well and it's
01:33:30 a weird
01:33:31 it's a weird uh nuance of humans
01:33:35 and i still don't understand why humans
01:33:37 are this way but they are this way
01:33:40 humans are bad at
01:33:44 cloning and copying
01:33:47 most humans and most companies
01:33:51 almost think that it's beneath them um
01:33:54 they somehow think it's kind of uh you
01:33:57 know
01:33:58 so and so what that does is it opens up
01:34:03 a significant window
01:34:06 of opportunities that would not exist
01:34:08 without it so
01:34:10 obviously we are right on the innovators
01:34:12 and the innovators you know grow and
01:34:14 scale and whatever
01:34:16 we do really well i mean you know uh uh
01:34:19 but
01:34:20 but if you if you uh
01:34:23 so if we look at a company like uh
01:34:26 microsoft for example um
01:34:30 microsoft is the ultimate cloner okay
01:34:34 um after they came up with the basic
01:34:37 compiler compiler in 1976 in
01:34:40 new mexico everything has been copied or
01:34:42 stolen
01:34:44 from then on and they're not even very
01:34:46 good at cloning
01:34:48 like you know uh when they try to clone
01:34:50 the mac
01:34:52 it took them like 15 years and 10
01:34:54 versions to get
01:34:56 get there you know and uh so um
01:35:00 excel was copied from lotus
01:35:03 and word was copied from word perfect uh
01:35:07 powerpoint was acquired
01:35:11 you know access copied oracle and
01:35:15 sybase and uh you know
01:35:18 um um
01:35:24 you know they finally gave up on
01:35:28 search and they kind of you know went
01:35:30 with google but
01:35:32 you know the acronym uh for bing
01:35:36 is but it's not google you know
01:35:40 so they they not only they're they're
01:35:42 not a good cloner they
01:35:43 many times they fail like forever they
01:35:45 tried to
01:35:46 clone quicken and they came out with
01:35:49 money
01:35:49 and they were never able to get traction
01:35:51 there they put a lot of effort into
01:35:53 search
01:35:54 they could never get traction there um
01:35:57 so
01:35:58 even with being a bad cloner you know
01:36:01 like for example now
01:36:03 uh microsoft has teams right
01:36:06 and teams copied uh slate right
01:36:10 and uh and uh and they will
01:36:13 probably you know kill slate uh because
01:36:17 they're such good they're so good at
01:36:18 uh eventually getting these things
01:36:21 working and then eventually the
01:36:22 incumbent uh has a problem uh
01:36:25 if you look at something about someone
01:36:26 like uh walmart
01:36:28 um for more than 10 or 15 years after
01:36:32 after sam walton founded walmart
01:36:35 for at least the first 15 years there
01:36:37 was no innovation
01:36:39 every single thing about walmart was
01:36:41 copied
01:36:42 from kmart and and sears they just they
01:36:45 just lifted that model
01:36:46 and the reason why sam walton spent all
01:36:49 this time
01:36:50 in all the comparative stores is because
01:36:52 he had no ideas of his own
01:36:54 he just looked at what other people are
01:36:55 doing and he
01:36:57 copied the best of what he could find
01:36:59 and
01:37:00 and that's what so if you look at
01:37:02 walmart i mean
01:37:04 what is the intellectual property of
01:37:06 walmart now after 15 20 years they got
01:37:08 you know a bunch of competitive
01:37:10 advantage with scale and logistics and
01:37:12 all of that
01:37:13 but in the first 10 or 15 years there's
01:37:15 no advantage
01:37:16 all they're doing is it's execution it's
01:37:19 great execution
01:37:21 on a on a base model if you look at
01:37:23 costco
01:37:24 uh everything about costco was copied
01:37:28 from price
01:37:29 price club so sold price uh
01:37:33 so if we talk to jim senegal
01:37:37 someone asked jim senegal what did you
01:37:39 learn
01:37:40 from soul price he said it's
01:37:43 the wrong question there's nothing i
01:37:46 know that i didn't learn from sole price
01:37:48 okay so the whole costco model
01:37:51 everything about it
01:37:53 and actually the cloner became better
01:37:55 than the original
01:37:56 you know like walmart became better than
01:37:58 kmart and
01:37:59 microsoft became better than so many
01:38:01 other companies so i think that
01:38:02 yes you can invest in the innovators
01:38:05 but i think that's much harder to get
01:38:08 right
01:38:10 um if if if
01:38:13 some businesses are consistent cloners
01:38:15 and they're good at it
01:38:18 and i don't think markets recognize
01:38:21 the power of great cloning so if you can
01:38:25 if you can identify
01:38:28 you know i think even even at some level
01:38:30 if you look at something someone like
01:38:32 starbucks
01:38:33 you know he looked at what was happening
01:38:35 in italy and he said i think this will
01:38:36 play in peoria
01:38:38 and he took that italian cafe and
01:38:40 brought it to period the funny thing is
01:38:41 now
01:38:42 starbucks is scaling in italy you know
01:38:45 who would have thought
01:38:45 that they can scale scale italy but
01:38:47 they're scaling in italy
01:38:49 um so i always feel that
01:38:52 if you can identify a business that is
01:38:56 good at cloning
01:38:58 and has kind of
01:39:01 embraced it the way nbr nvr embraced the
01:39:04 buybacks
01:39:06 that's a great mental model and
01:39:08 advantage to have in your arsenal
01:39:11 really appreciate it i was curious if
01:39:13 you could talk a little bit about
01:39:16 how you document your investing process
01:39:19 um earlier you mentioned a bit of a
01:39:20 checklist
01:39:22 and uh you mentioned a little bit about
01:39:25 focusing and really honing in on those
01:39:27 two or three variables that you really
01:39:29 have to understand
01:39:31 so maybe just talk about that checklist
01:39:33 you know do you write things
01:39:35 down do you do excel models or you know
01:39:38 what gets put to paper and what's the
01:39:39 output along the way
01:39:41 from idea to purchase for for most
01:39:44 for most of my career i
01:39:48 functioned alone and now
01:39:52 now because uh i had another entity and
01:39:54 i've got uh
01:39:55 horsepower so i've got two guys who
01:39:59 uh help me and work with me
01:40:03 i i have not i think almost never built
01:40:07 excel models or anything like that
01:40:09 they they they will do that sometimes
01:40:12 and
01:40:12 and such but the precision can be
01:40:16 uh can lead you astray uh because
01:40:19 businesses are not
01:40:21 they're not linear and they don't you
01:40:22 know grow 15 a year
01:40:24 every year and so on um so i think
01:40:41 model in your head where you're able to
01:40:44 figure out
01:40:45 uh kind of what um
01:40:50 uh what is going on and how this
01:40:52 business works and how it makes money
01:40:55 and and then you know you go deeper and
01:40:57 see if
01:40:58 all the facts uh check out
01:41:02 the the checklist comes in before the
01:41:04 investment
01:41:06 and the main the main benefit the
01:41:09 checklist has
01:41:11 is that you know we are we are driven
01:41:15 by greed so when we when we encounter
01:41:19 some new shiny new investment ideas we
01:41:22 can be enamored by it
01:41:24 and the checklist kind of puts a lot of
01:41:27 cold water a lot of stuff
01:41:28 so it asks a bunch of questions that
01:41:32 the big advantage it has is that many
01:41:33 times i've not even thought about those
01:41:35 questions
01:41:36 so i think i've thought about every side
01:41:38 of it but when i actually go through the
01:41:40 individual questions uh like i think our
01:41:42 checklist has about 160 questions on it
01:41:45 and
01:41:45 i'll find that i don't know the answers
01:41:47 to 10 questions
01:41:49 and which means that i have more work to
01:41:51 do
01:41:52 and so that's the big advantage is like
01:41:54 it identifies holes
01:41:57 in the analysis um and then i
01:42:00 go back and you know do the work to be
01:42:03 able to
01:42:04 uh answer those ten questions so that's
01:42:06 where the the checklist comes in it's
01:42:08 really just trying to make sure you've
01:42:10 thought about things uh in a complete
01:42:13 in a complete manner and also what it
01:42:16 also
01:42:16 shows you is there are no businesses
01:42:20 maybe other than costco that go through
01:42:22 a checklist with no blemishes
01:42:24 like everything is fine every business
01:42:29 has issues uh and
01:42:33 those issues will get highlighted by the
01:42:35 checklist
01:42:36 and the question you gotta decide is
01:42:40 is this issue going to be the one that
01:42:42 does them in
01:42:44 right and so you've got to make a
01:42:45 judgment call um
01:42:47 on on that so there are i mean i think
01:42:49 that
01:42:50 it's part art part science uh so you you
01:42:53 can look at the
01:42:55 areas where the business has
01:42:58 vulnerabilities
01:42:59 and issues and then you've got to just
01:43:01 see hey can i
01:43:03 does it still make sense
01:43:07 when i know these are the areas where
01:43:09 the business may have difficulty
01:43:11 um does it still make sense hi sir
01:43:15 thank you thank you for your time i saw
01:43:17 a speech of you and you mentioned that
01:43:19 you
01:43:20 invested in one skill company that is
01:43:22 unvalued and you made
01:43:23 over 100 return and just have and one
01:43:26 year
01:43:27 i want what to use to find out a company
01:43:30 that is
01:43:31 unvalued you read the balance sheet or
01:43:33 you have other tools
01:43:35 we made a 4x on that company in a couple
01:43:38 of years
01:43:39 there was a company called ipsco uh the
01:43:42 canadian steel company and there i think
01:43:44 it was a relatively simple thesis where
01:43:48 the stock was in the low 40s and they
01:43:50 had no debt they had about 15
01:43:52 a share in cash and the next two years
01:43:55 of
01:43:56 contracts that they had on their books
01:43:58 was going to give them
01:44:00 about 15 a year in in
01:44:03 earnings and so my take was and and
01:44:07 it's it's a very high uncertainty
01:44:09 business with a lot of
01:44:11 fluctuation in earnings because they
01:44:14 made uh
01:44:15 tubular steel which went into pipelines
01:44:17 so if a big pipeline is being built then
01:44:19 they have contracts and
01:44:21 there could be no contracts after a
01:44:23 couple of years right
01:44:24 so so the uh the situation was
01:44:27 you know i'm paying 45 a share and i
01:44:30 fast forward two years
01:44:32 i have 45 on the balance sheet and all
01:44:35 the plants and equipment and
01:44:36 inventory is free so i said that
01:44:40 that doesn't make sense the business has
01:44:42 to have a value over 45 dollars
01:44:45 because all those things can be
01:44:46 liquidated for some price
01:44:48 if you're if you're not a going concern
01:44:50 and if you're a going concern it has
01:44:52 even more value than a liquidation
01:44:54 uh scenario so i said you know what i'm
01:44:57 going to do is i'm just going to buy
01:44:58 this company and
01:44:59 own it for two years and just see what
01:45:01 the market does
01:45:02 the price you know because i said let
01:45:05 the
01:45:05 30 come in and let's see what the market
01:45:08 does and
01:45:08 i think about eight or ten months after
01:45:10 i bought it
01:45:11 the company said that they have one more
01:45:14 year
01:45:15 of fifteen dollars a share in earnings
01:45:18 and so i said oh so now we are at sixty
01:45:20 dollars right because we've got three
01:45:22 years of fifteen dollars
01:45:23 and the stock went to by that time it
01:45:25 had gone to
01:45:27 seventy eighty dollars a share at that
01:45:29 time and then uh
01:45:30 it was inching up to maybe about 90 and
01:45:32 then
01:45:34 a swedish company came and offered to
01:45:36 buy them
01:45:38 for 160 a share
01:45:41 in 2006 and
01:45:44 i didn't even wait for the deal to close
01:45:46 the stock went to like 150 something
01:45:49 and five minutes after that i was out of
01:45:50 there um
01:45:52 and uh so that that was fine and um
01:45:56 so if you um if you look at
01:45:59 uh value investors club um
01:46:03 and you read you know write-ups there
01:46:06 that's a good place to uh understand and
01:46:10 find businesses uh
01:46:12 if you have a subscription to sum zero
01:46:14 or you're a member of sum
01:46:15 zero that's another area where you can
01:46:17 get
01:46:18 uh some some of this and then you know
01:46:21 sometimes there are articles and seeking
01:46:23 alpha and so on so there's a few
01:46:24 different places
01:46:26 and then you know you can look at data
01:46:27 aroma and then you can try to reverse
01:46:29 engineer
01:46:31 why does david pepper own this or why
01:46:33 does uh
01:46:35 you know apple known something and so on
01:46:38 so you can try to reverse engineer
01:46:40 some of those and take it from there
01:46:43 um so and you know the different things
01:46:47 happen like you know
01:46:49 last year i was i visited a company in
01:46:55 turkey
01:46:56 in istanbul and uh
01:46:59 you know they they they have a few
01:47:02 different businesses but they have a
01:47:03 bunch of warehouses
01:47:05 uh they have like 12 million square feet
01:47:07 of warehouses
01:47:08 and uh they're the largest warehouse
01:47:10 operator in turkey and they're
01:47:12 they're their tenants are all like ikea
01:47:16 car for amazon and so on and they've got
01:47:20 really really blue chip tenants
01:47:22 and the market cap of the company was
01:47:25 like
01:47:26 less than 30 million dollars
01:47:31 and the liquidation value was somewhere
01:47:34 between
01:47:36 maybe three four hundred million to a
01:47:37 billion dollars
01:47:40 okay and
01:47:43 once i had you know kicked the tires
01:47:46 enough
01:47:47 to know that all those things were real
01:47:50 you know and you know
01:47:52 we spent an afternoon going to all the
01:47:54 warehouses and so on
01:47:56 um you know we
01:47:59 loaded up even better than ipsco
01:48:03 right if i can buy a
01:48:06 asset for 30 million that on a bad day
01:48:09 is worth 300 million
01:48:11 um you know turkey has a lot of
01:48:15 challenges
01:48:16 but uh in many cases micro will trump
01:48:19 macro
01:48:21 and at at some price uh your
01:48:25 your your risk levels go down that that
01:48:28 business has gone up
01:48:29 uh about seven eight times in value
01:48:34 in the last 13 14 months
01:48:38 in spite of the pandemic and all that so
01:48:41 anyway so what i'm saying is that uh
01:48:44 you keep poking around and once in a
01:48:47 while things hit you in the head like a
01:48:48 two by four
01:48:50 and when they hit you in a headband when
01:48:52 they say what what is that
01:48:54 like you know when you're like really
01:48:55 like shocked and surprised
01:48:58 that's when you act it was like if
01:49:00 you're just saying ah yeah okay whatever
01:49:02 just ignore all of those look at the
01:49:05 ones that totally blow you away
01:49:08 and then go for those
01:49:12 shock at all in your book a lot about
01:49:14 the kelly criterion but you kind of say
01:49:16 you
01:49:17 you think you never go for kelly or
01:49:18 anything like that so how much of a role
01:49:20 does it play in your capital asset
01:49:22 allocation decisions is it more of like
01:49:24 a guideline
01:49:25 um and do you or you know hard and fast
01:49:27 like do the math out
01:49:29 kind of thing and then you know a
01:49:31 follow-up would be like do you
01:49:32 apply it to your entire portfolio or
01:49:34 just your dry powder if i ever do a
01:49:37 revision to the dhandu investor i will
01:49:39 take out the kelly
01:49:41 discussion entirely and in fact i will
01:49:42 even say that
01:49:44 it doesn't apply to investing so i don't
01:49:47 use the kelly and it was a mistake to
01:49:49 put in the book
01:49:50 the main issue with the kelly criteria
01:49:52 is that it works
01:49:53 really well if we get to make a bunch of
01:49:58 similar bets like if we do 100 coin
01:50:00 tosses
01:50:01 where heads is 51 percent and tails is
01:50:03 49
01:50:05 and i keep betting heads you can use
01:50:07 that formula to figure out
01:50:09 if you have 100 how much you should put
01:50:11 on each bet
01:50:13 so it's good for when you get a
01:50:17 opportunity to make many bets
01:50:20 which are very similar in odds uh
01:50:24 but it doesn't apply like when i talked
01:50:25 about the company in
01:50:27 in turkey or the steel company whatever
01:50:30 else i mean those are
01:50:31 investing we're making one bet at a time
01:50:35 and we don't have the
01:50:39 have the luxury of making a second or
01:50:41 third bet like that
01:50:43 so i would just ignore kelly completely
01:50:47 i know it sounds exciting and everything
01:50:49 but it's not relevant
01:50:52 um so how do you manage the balance
01:50:54 between say diversification and then
01:50:57 also you talked about about staying
01:50:58 within your circle of confidence so
01:51:00 how do you like manage those things
01:51:02 without like throwing away everything
01:51:04 you can throw away nearly everything and
01:51:07 that's fine
01:51:09 so uh arvind stall heard me talk many
01:51:12 times about
01:51:13 charlie's friend john ryega in
01:51:16 northern california who's a billionaire
01:51:18 and all he's done in his career
01:51:21 is invest in real estate within a couple
01:51:24 of miles of the stanford campus
01:51:26 so john ariega's circular competence
01:51:30 is like this small it's really tiny
01:51:34 it's not even real estate it's not even
01:51:36 real estate in california it's not even
01:51:38 real estate in
01:51:39 northern california it's real estate in
01:51:40 a very
01:51:42 narrow geography if you showed him a
01:51:44 deal in sacramento
01:51:46 it would take him a femtosecond to say
01:51:48 i'm not interested
01:51:50 because he he doesn't want to go there
01:51:54 so and with being
01:51:58 with being in a very very narrow circle
01:52:00 of competence
01:52:02 it did not prevent him from becoming
01:52:04 extremely wealthy
01:52:06 so the good thing about investing is
01:52:09 that it doesn't matter
01:52:12 how big your circular competence is uh
01:52:15 what is really important
01:52:18 is to not step out of it
01:52:21 and what is even more important is just
01:52:24 try to play
01:52:25 in the epicenter of that circle
01:52:28 so if you look at a business and you say
01:52:32 i'm not sure about this or i don't
01:52:35 understand this
01:52:36 or whatever be a harsh grader and get
01:52:39 rid of it
01:52:41 and you know focus on the most obvious
01:52:44 stuff and
01:52:44 some of the most obvious stuff is things
01:52:47 that we are consumers of
01:52:50 so if you're using a certain brand or
01:52:53 you're using some service
01:52:54 or whatever else you know like uh like
01:52:58 you know
01:52:59 i like to bike and uh a lot of the
01:53:02 biking parts come
01:53:03 from a company called shimano in japan
01:53:08 and i know from biking that shimano has
01:53:12 very strong brand recognition and
01:53:14 they've got pricing power and all these
01:53:15 things
01:53:16 i've never looked at a balance sheet i
01:53:17 just know this from the way they
01:53:19 dominate in cycling and then i
01:53:21 looked at them i also found they
01:53:22 dominated in fishing
01:53:25 and that's even in the fishing area
01:53:26 they've got and they've innovated a lot
01:53:29 uh in that area so i looked at
01:53:32 shimano and it didn't look obviously
01:53:35 cheap
01:53:36 like i was hoping that no one else would
01:53:38 understand shimano and it would be a two
01:53:40 times earnings
01:53:41 and the rest would be history but it
01:53:44 wasn't that easy so i said oh you know
01:53:46 it's like a double digit earnings
01:53:47 whatever forget about it you know move
01:53:49 on
01:53:50 you know if it was really cheap i would
01:53:52 spend more time on it you know
01:53:54 so um and i only looked at that because
01:53:57 i was just familiar with it from cycling
01:53:59 right
01:54:00 so it can come at you from different
01:54:02 places
01:54:04 you uh you mentioned sergio from uh from
01:54:06 fiat then obviously howard schultz
01:54:08 starbucks sam walton um obviously all
01:54:11 very uh
01:54:13 you know great leaders um i'm curious
01:54:15 kind of what you look for
01:54:16 you know certain traits that you look
01:54:18 for in a board or a ceo
01:54:21 management team you know when you're
01:54:23 making those investments how you kind of
01:54:25 judge a management team
01:54:27 and then if there's any specific uh your
01:54:29 other specific leaders that have really
01:54:30 stuck out
01:54:31 in today's market good question so the
01:54:34 way to
01:54:36 the way to figure out the quality of the
01:54:39 leader
01:54:40 is to not focus on what they're saying
01:54:42 but to focus on what they've done
01:54:44 so typically these guys have track
01:54:47 records
01:54:48 and you can look back at the track
01:54:50 record i mean
01:54:51 you know it would have been hard to
01:54:53 invest in walmart in 1970 or whatever if
01:54:55 you were really unless you were
01:54:57 really familiar with sam but if you're
01:54:59 investing in 1980 or
01:55:00 1990 you got quite a quite a track
01:55:03 record to look at
01:55:04 um sergio it was very obvious to me in
01:55:08 2012
01:55:09 what i was a very unusual and good
01:55:11 leader and i was very excited that
01:55:14 we were able to actually and it actually
01:55:17 as that investment progressed uh
01:55:21 my my assessment of him kept getting
01:55:24 better
01:55:25 you know like i had underestimated how
01:55:27 good he was he just kept getting better
01:55:29 and better
01:55:30 and uh and such and uh
01:55:33 uh so i think the the the sim one thing
01:55:36 we have is
01:55:38 as public market investors which
01:55:42 venture investors don't have is we do
01:55:44 have trend marks
01:55:46 that we can look at and we do have
01:55:48 relatively long histories
01:55:50 uh that you can look at and uh so i
01:55:53 think that
01:55:54 that is really helpful and that's really
01:55:57 important
01:55:57 it's really important to get a mental
01:56:00 model in your mind
01:56:01 about the nature of the leader and the
01:56:04 quality of the leader
01:56:06 and you know their nuances and you don't
01:56:09 need to
01:56:10 you don't need to always get this right
01:56:11 i mean there's an error rate
01:56:15 you know when i bought when i bought
01:56:17 fiat
01:56:18 i also bought gm and uh
01:56:21 gm basically we made some money i think
01:56:23 we made 40 50
01:56:25 on what we invested after several years
01:56:28 but eventually i sold it because
01:56:29 i just saw differences very big
01:56:31 differences
01:56:33 so that was a good example because i i
01:56:35 felt like gm had
01:56:37 competent leadership
01:56:40 but it was nothing nothing like sergio
01:56:43 and then you know if you look at
01:56:45 uh someone like elon you know i mean
01:56:47 he's on a different planet
01:56:49 you know i mean i i i don't know if you
01:56:52 guys saw
01:56:54 battery day um you know the the
01:56:57 when he had the battery day and the
01:56:59 annual meeting uh recently i mean i
01:57:02 i if i was a competitor of elon
01:57:06 any any oem car manufacturer
01:57:10 i'd be very afraid because
01:57:14 those guys every other ceo has no
01:57:17 understanding of
01:57:18 first principles of physics and
01:57:21 and and so i think they're gonna have a
01:57:23 very very hard time
01:57:26 uh and he's increasing the distance so
01:57:29 uh
01:57:29 so we don't know how that works out but
01:57:31 i would just say that
01:57:33 um you know uh
01:57:36 extremely impressive guy and uh and
01:57:39 kind of strange you know somewhat weird
01:57:41 you know so
01:57:42 uh i i'm in the charlie munger boat
01:57:45 which is saying you know
01:57:47 don't go long or don't go short elon um
01:57:51 it's hard to go long elon because just
01:57:53 so expensive
01:57:55 uh but i i would not want to short a guy
01:58:00 who lands two rockets simultaneously
01:58:03 backwards
01:58:04 uh i mean i don't know why anyone would
01:58:08 own a shorter guy like that
01:58:10 so um so anyway i mean i think that
01:58:13 uh you study the the history and the
01:58:15 trademarks
01:58:18 so monash you've been so generous with
01:58:20 your time that
01:58:21 you know thank you so much i guess maybe
01:58:23 i would
01:58:24 end with one last question which is you
01:58:27 know
01:58:28 on this zoom call there are students who
01:58:32 are graduating from business school
01:58:34 from college um just
01:58:37 that you know the world has shifted
01:58:39 dramatically
01:58:40 they may feel for their opportunities
01:58:43 that
01:58:44 um are there any thoughts that you have
01:58:47 or
01:58:48 that you any advice that you would give
01:58:50 over the decades to come
01:58:52 and also the short term you know a
01:58:55 couple of thoughts
01:58:57 um so one is that
01:59:00 in in an advanced civilization
01:59:04 like the united states um
01:59:08 the odds that any of you
01:59:12 will be homeless or you know
01:59:16 not have enough food to eat or
01:59:20 you know can't pay your rent or any of
01:59:21 that is those odds approach zero
01:59:25 um so basically the bottom line is that
01:59:27 the society has enough safety nets and
01:59:29 has
01:59:30 enough opportunities that
01:59:33 none of you will ever face those
01:59:35 circumstances
01:59:37 so given that reality uh what i would
01:59:41 what i would focus on if i were you is
01:59:44 i would focus on the pursuit of passion
01:59:48 so i would really try to figure out what
01:59:52 is really exciting for you and what you
01:59:55 really like to do and you know
01:59:57 one of the things buffett talks about is
01:59:59 people will say oh you know
02:00:00 i'm going to um do banking for three
02:00:03 years then i'm going to get my mba
02:00:06 then i'm going to do xyz and then you
02:00:09 know after
02:00:10 10 years i'm gonna do my own thing uh
02:00:13 you don't need to take these
02:00:15 long circuits paths um
02:00:19 think about what you want to do and just
02:00:21 go for it
02:00:22 you know get there uh
02:00:26 without making a 20-year plan to get
02:00:28 there
02:00:29 and one of the i think one of the
02:00:31 problems that comes up
02:00:33 when you when you graduate from elite
02:00:36 institutions
02:00:38 so the problem you have when you
02:00:40 graduate from boston college or
02:00:42 harvard is the opportunity cost
02:00:46 so what happens is that the world is
02:00:49 willing to pay
02:00:51 quite a bit for your services
02:00:55 and many times they willing the world is
02:00:58 willing to pay
02:00:59 more for your services than you would
02:01:02 make
02:01:02 if you pursued your passion
02:01:06 and and if you pursue your passion you
02:01:09 are giving up
02:01:09 a lot of certainty but
02:01:13 given that i told you that you're not
02:01:14 going to end up homeless
02:01:16 and you're not going to end up with no
02:01:18 food on your table
02:01:20 i would say that stretch a bit
02:01:24 and uh and try to uh
02:01:28 try to try to understand internally what
02:01:31 uh what you love to do and um
02:01:34 and then uh and and the the other thing
02:01:37 is that
02:01:38 um even if you take the
02:01:42 the easy path which is some guy's giving
02:01:45 you a great offer and
02:01:46 it looks great whatever
02:01:49 you still have plenty of time
02:01:52 evenings weekends etc to try to think
02:01:55 about
02:01:56 what else might be your passion or
02:01:58 interest and to try to build
02:02:00 something like my first business i got
02:02:03 off the ground part
02:02:04 time while i was working full time and
02:02:06 then when it got enough traction i
02:02:08 resigned
02:02:09 and i didn't have any money or anything
02:02:11 i actually
02:02:12 was on credit cards and so on to try to
02:02:14 get it up and running
02:02:15 um so that's what i would say is that
02:02:19 uh the
02:02:22 younger you are when you do that uh it's
02:02:25 easier
02:02:28 when you don't have kids and do that
02:02:29 it's easier
02:02:31 and when you're single and you do that
02:02:32 it's easier so
02:02:35 for many of you all of those are true
02:02:37 and uh
02:02:38 and so i that's what i would suggest is
02:02:41 if you really want to go down a certain
02:02:45 path
02:02:46 uh i think you should uh
02:02:49 really think about you know
02:02:53 we we humans are driven by peers
02:02:56 and we like to compare ourselves to
02:02:58 peers and you have a lot of peers
02:03:01 uh in the in the institutions you're at
02:03:04 uh and so it can be uh it can be
02:03:06 difficult
02:03:08 to do something i i remember that the
02:03:12 uh the founder of i think it was staples
02:03:16 um uh went to went to harvard business
02:03:20 school
02:03:21 and then after that he uh
02:03:25 joined some grocer and i think while he
02:03:28 was in school he was
02:03:30 working um in a grocery store
02:03:34 you know kind of doing the shelves and
02:03:36 whatever else
02:03:37 you know and he said that some harvard
02:03:40 professor walked into the store
02:03:42 saw him doing that and didn't want to
02:03:45 embarrass him and just kind of
02:03:46 went the other way and he went
02:03:50 out and you know reached out to the
02:03:52 professor and said how are you doing
02:03:54 whatever
02:03:55 he was not at all concerned and so um
02:03:59 so that guy wanted to go into retail
02:04:03 in spite of all the things i've said
02:04:06 and he was passionate about it
02:04:09 and he turned down a lot of other offers
02:04:11 which were
02:04:12 probably higher paying and he went into
02:04:15 that area and eventually
02:04:17 uh founded stables and went from there
02:04:19 you know so so you have to be willing to
02:04:22 uh to get off the beaten path you know
02:04:26 and
02:04:26 that's what i would suggest is uh be be
02:04:29 willing and bold to do that
02:04:31 what a great note to end on money thank
02:04:34 you
02:04:35 so much this is fantastic as always
02:04:37 thank you arvind it was a
02:04:39 pleasure thank you thank you
02:04:53 [Music]
02:05:02 you
