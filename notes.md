* Maggie maher book on the ups and downs of the stock market: from 1965-82 completley flat, this even W buffet says its does not move, then from 62-99 it went crazy and at 99-Market was 
Euphoric. At 99-2016 again low multiples and less happening. Now from 2016- ?? (late 2025 or end 2030)

* And the behaviour from Pabrai was bit interesting, he started the fund at 99 before that around 94-99 he invested in two stocks made a many millions like Satyam 10k -> 1 million 
and CMGI 10K -> 10 Million and by 99' he opened up the Pabraifunds 

* since 99- till now his Strategy was buy for 50 cents worth of 1$ and sell for 90 cents and his being doing that for a while. But, in hindsight this approach is not good and it makes 
sense just to hold on like he did from 95-99 period.
