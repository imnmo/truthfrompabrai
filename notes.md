# Caroll school of management

* Maggie maher book on the ups and downs of the stock market: from 1965-82 completley flat, this even W buffet says its does not move, then from 62-99 it went crazy and at 99-Market was 
Euphoric. At 99-2016 again low multiples and less happening. Now from 2016- ?? (late 2025 or end 2030)

# Initial Net worth: 
* And the behaviour from Pabrai was bit interesting, he started the fund at 99 before that around 94-99 he invested in two stocks made a many millions like Satyam 10K -> 1 million 
and CMGI 1Ã¼0K -> 10 Million and by 99' he opened up the Pabraifunds 

* since 99- till now his Strategy was buy for 50 cents worth of 1$ and sell for 90 cents and his being doing that for a while. But, in hindsight this approach is not good and it makes 
sense just to hold on like he did from 95-99 period.

# Valuation metrics | Businesss:
* Holy grail of investing RRS -> recurring revenue stream
* FCA: doing 130 plus billion in revenue and a five six billion dollar market cap and eek out 3-4 % then its multi bagger
* Important is it really within **circle of competence** and figuring 2-3 key varibales of the business eg. NVR key1: the dont build homes unless someone bought the house, so its capital light. Key2: They dont own any land, which again makes easy for their business. After identifying these keys, the CEO should be honing onto these points and steering the ship. Like: the exmaple of rollins the key was to steer onto the tranings and 
* what other investors are buying like chuck akre, david tepper, jeff urben and their pattersn
* one filter is oher investors already bought this stock especiall top 3 or larger holdings in their portfolio or can reverse engineer them to construct a thesis

* its a great mental model
* cloning and copying most humans and most companies are better of great example is MSFT cloned mac, aws and so on and they are here to stay also Samsung copied apple
* Walmart sam copied exclusively from kmart & sears
* markets recognize the power of great cloning alos Starbucks
